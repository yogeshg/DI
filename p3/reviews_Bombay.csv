"Tajmahal hotel one of the best hotel international hotel of india. Good food good service well decoration over all I am very pleased  with the service of Tajmahal Hotel india. If i visit India again specially Mumbai, definitely i will say here agai and i will recomand all to visit Tajmahal hotel. ",ChIJ____b8DR5zsRVz_XpIUEKcA
"Best hotel I have ever stayed at.

Which ended up with probably the most expensive hotel bill I've ever seen. But totally worth it.

I utilised the facilities to the fill and had a massage, used the pool, ate in the restaurants, and had breakfast here too.

Best ever!

Can't recommend enough.

It was slightly eerie setting the halls that were on the news a few years ago, but they have company rebuilt the damaged parts leaving an extra special hotel.

We started in the palace side with a sea view. If you can stretch that far, do the same.",ChIJ____b8DR5zsRVz_XpIUEKcA
The The Taj Mahal Palace is very nice. I was visiting mumbai for 15 days. I am staying in the same hotel said. The hotel's service is very good. .....,ChIJ____b8DR5zsRVz_XpIUEKcA
"Breakfast, Tea and dinner at the sea lounge amazing place and very relaxing takes u away from the hustle and bustle of the city and if u lucky u might get to see bollywood stars saw Salman Khan and his brothers having tea stayed here few times now not even once it disappointed me cant wait to stay there again
",ChIJ____b8DR5zsRVz_XpIUEKcA
"Brilliant stay! We had a great time in a Palace Wing room with a small balcony overlooking the poolside. Our other room, which the kids stayed also had a small balcony with partial sea view. Breakfast at the Sea lounge is pure decadent luxury, This hotel drips heritage & regal ambience & you are in the most coveted location of Mumbai. Furthermore you are treated very well from check in stage itself, typical of the Taj ethos. A tragic tinge of history adds valor & grandeur, if nothing else...",ChIJ____b8DR5zsRVz_XpIUEKcA

RBI is promoting Kiosk Banking in different rural and urban areas to provide banking solutions to maximum population of India. Unfortunately service providers(Banks) are not providing proper support to kiosk operators.I can say this strongly because I am also kiosk operator of SBI. I am handling my kiosk since last 1.5 years and I faced lot of problems due to lackness of support of my parental company(State Bank of India).Presently our server has been blocked since last 4 days and we are unable provide very essential services to our customers. Students scholarship accounts are also pending due to that. We are facing server problem since last 8-9 months and its hampering our services time to time.Kiosk.Customers and kiosk operators both are suffering very much due to that and its also make blockage to fulfill the purpose of kiosk banking.Its my humble request to RBI to make intervention on the matter.,ChIJYzmrGtvR5zsRnkXI7onJ3tA
"I had heard great things about this hospital, from relatives and friends. I went for a medical check up which was on May 2nd, 2015. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the way they did our check ups, everything was VERY mechanical. There were 4 people that were extremely helpful and nice to us but the rest of them treated us like we were a bother to them, because we were asking questions. I am not a Dr nor a Nurse but I do believe it is common for a physician to ask you what is wrong with your health so that after your check up (SOLITAIRE PLUS) you can then check for other problems. 

We wasted so much time in this hospital! If Lilavati hospital had a plan to follow especially for international patients you could be in an out within 2 days but we ended up going back to the hospital for 4 days simply because no physician had bothered to read our complaints before we started the check up.

The Physician who read my reports after the check up spent less then 3 minutes going through my report, he was so busy trying to get me out of his office he forgot to even tell me one critical thing about my health!!!!!!

To make matters worse, instead of sending me my results directly they sent my medical reports to my sister!!!!!!!!! What ever happened to Medical reports are PRIVATE!!!

I personally don't think I will be returning to this hospital SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  What a shame!",ChIJCexkMT_J5zsRPxlq4wf_4Yw
Impressed with extremely fast service and care. Good to see such staff at a hospital ,ChIJCexkMT_J5zsRPxlq4wf_4Yw

TISS taught me to look at life from a different perspective. Its environment helped me understand everyone is unique the way they are and we need not try to be something which we are not. Its almost close to perfect sample of INDIA as a whole. Humanity has its highest concerns at TISS. Apart from this TISS is all about celebrating life between hectic Academics.,ChIJx2VKQAjG5zsRNoir7I4Aric
"My association with TISS goes way back to 1969. I joined TISS on 22nd December 1969 as a UGC JRF for my doctoral research. I was in the campus till July 1973, the year I finished my work. Finally submitted my thesis on 19th November 1973 and got my Ph.D degree finally on 5th May 1974. I have very fond memories of my days spent in TISS. The best part has been the enabling enviornment of the Institute which allows people to live their dreams. All this could not have been possible without the enabling leadership of late Prof. M. S. Gore and my research guide and mentor Prof. K. G. Desai. They have played a very important role in shaping my life. I am sure TISSians accross the genarations would agree with me.",ChIJx2VKQAjG5zsRNoir7I4Aric

Very good hospital yesterday my masi kidney transperency done in proper manner and Dr is wonderful staff also ok.,ChIJk3X00XbO5zsRx2UpTspHr3M
"My doctor did not spend any time talking to my family about my condition at all. Also, he barely saw me while I was there, merely peeping in for a minute or two everyday. His negligence almost killed me; he forgot to write in his note to the nurse that I required equal amounts of the drug and water to be administered at the same time. If my family had not noticed the nurse starting the drug, I would have been dead that day.
Also, I once had an allergic reaction to a drug given to me. I was suffocating, and none of the people in the hospital knew what to do with me. I have had an atrocious experience at this hospital, and I would certainly say that, if you are a juvenile who has cancer, DO NOT GO THERE. However, I do recognise that other departments of the hospital may be excellent, and I just don't know about them.",ChIJk3X00XbO5zsRx2UpTspHr3M
