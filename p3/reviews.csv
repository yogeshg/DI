"Half Dome. I did this 16 mile hike at the end August.  Perfect time of year. Not to hot with a nice breeze all day. The 2 large water falls you will pass are still going and beautiful however if you want to see them full go in June. Note: be ready for 3 miles of steps at the beginning then you hit the forest.  You have to be a part of the lottery to get on Half Dome. Ranger will be there to check.  The cables are not as scary as people think. Have rubber grip gloves!!! And make sure your standing on the wood while your waiting to go up and down. People going up and down share the same cable path. This is fine until your around a group who can't get it together. A little communication and direction goes a long way. The view at the top is spectacular and well worth it

We spent four days in Yosemite and did not want to leave.  Every turn held more beauty than we expected.  The valley held its own beauty and we were humbled by the size of the surrounding peaks.  We slept in a Best Western just south of a park entrance and it was perfect for day trips.  The feeling of being in a cathedral never left us as we stopped in deserted spots and just gazed at our surroundings.  ,ChIJxeyK9Z3wloAR_gOA7SycJC0
"Jwell of Northern California... All the hiking trails have their unique aspects... 
So try different way to reach the destinations...
Wear nice Grip Shoes...
Good Luck!!",ChIJxeyK9Z3wloAR_gOA7SycJC0
"$30 fee?  It looked like a shortcut to Napa, but the slow winding roads and the constant mysterious orange cones of construction with invisible workers made the trip through a 7 hour misery.  
I'm slightly handicapped and there were VERY FEW places of interest for me and my walking sticks. Now I don't expect wheelchair access to the peak of El Captain, but access to a lake or scenic vista would be nice. Even on a Wednesday in August there was little no access to parking unless you were able to park alongside of the road and everyone piled out of the driver's side into traffic. 
Did I mention the $1.00 a gallon surcharge on gasoline on the two stations on either side of the park?  That is on top of California's already high prices. A couple miles out of the park and they drop to normal high taxed prices. 
I gave it two stars because there were a couple pullouts for some pretty spectacular views, but there are a lot of spectacular views where you don't get robbed to drive past them. ",ChIJxeyK9Z3wloAR_gOA7SycJC0
"Most beautiful national park that I've been so far. You need to prepare for several days to explore this park. I'm very lucky to see the bear, one the first day in the park! Awesome for wildlife and nature. Look forward to go back again.",ChIJxeyK9Z3wloAR_gOA7SycJC0
"A great collection of art, exhibits that anyone can enjoy.

A little known fact is that the museum is donation based, you are welcome to donate however much you want per person.   This was perfect for us visiting New York because we only wanted to stay for a little while and didn't want to pay the full amount for being there only a few hours.

It's something everyone should check out while in New York City, it's a great art museum that everyone can enjoy and appreciate. ",ChIJb8Jg9pZYwokR-qHGtvSkLzs
"One of the best museum in the world. Thousands and thousands collections from Asia, Europe, and Africa etc. Every collection will definitely make you wow. The exhibition rooms are exquisite, clean, and well organized. Tip for travelers, plan at least half day or entire day in the museum. $25 per person. ",ChIJb8Jg9pZYwokR-qHGtvSkLzs
"HUGE!  That's the best word to describe the MET.   If you have to chose only one museum to visit in NYC, it would be the MET.  You could spend two days there, and still probably not look at everything.  We didn't get to see it all, due to time restrictions.

Great sculpture collection.  The armor and sword collection is vast and informative as well.",ChIJb8Jg9pZYwokR-qHGtvSkLzs
"This museum is most definitely a 5 stars museum. Clean, everything is in place, professional people, and headphones that really make it so much more interesting. I just couldn?t get enough of this place. Take your time, appreciate the beauty, put your phone away for a while, and go back in time. 

Even if you are not into art, you must visit this place at least once, I find it hard to believe the there is someone who won?t find at least one piece there beautiful. And the head phones really make it more special, since when there is a story, things looks different, and get much deeper meaning.
",ChIJb8Jg9pZYwokR-qHGtvSkLzs
"How can you not like a museum like the MET... Being a New Yorker, I know that you need few days to real cover it, and that the exhibitions always worth a visit.
One of things I love here is the different languages you hear while visiting, and one of the things I hate is the crazy amount of photos people take. I wish they will stop people from taking pictures, since it really damage the exhibits. Or at least have no photos days, for people who just want to enjoy art, and don?t have to take it home with them...

I wish I could give negative stars. The TSA personnel are horrible at ORD. I have never had a positive experiance with TSA here. Prepare yourself for how rude they are and kill them with kindness. You'll have a better trip and they might have an ounce of guilt for their treatment to Joe public. Life is too short TSA. Smile.,ChIJ82J3aie0D4gRS61ZAgdHF1E
"I have never had a flight that arrived or left this airport on time. I've gotten hosed flying through multiple times with planes not even showing up, and they overbook like crazy so if you're not super early you can get kicked. Everything is criminally expensive, and the staff at the shops hardly speak English and are for the most part extremely rude. The janitorial staff seems far more interested in yukking it up with each other than keeping the airport clean, oh and half the stalls in the bathrooms are fucked up and either don't close, don't lock, or have no door at all. I do my very best to avoid flying through this airport.",ChIJ82J3aie0D4gRS61ZAgdHF1E
Absolute Zoo. Took an hour to get thru the TSA check point. Hope I never have to travel thru that airport again..,ChIJ82J3aie0D4gRS61ZAgdHF1E
"Horrible TSA officer at Terminal one of United. I came one hour ahead of time but the security check line was very long. After forty minutes I was quite worried and asked an office named Zacunn***(i couldn't catch his full name). He sarcastically replied me with very unpleasant manor, ""the airport has been top three busiest airport for last xx years. You gonna be kidding me of only be here one hour ahead of time"" and walked away. I was shocked by how rude this staff member is. ",ChIJ82J3aie0D4gRS61ZAgdHF1E
"While security was packed, TSA agents moved people quickly and amicably. There are plenty of good options for dining, books and things for kids. The bathrooms were spotless. There were no delayed flights I saw, and there were numerous flights landing and taking off and traffic control kept everyone moving.",ChIJ82J3aie0D4gRS61ZAgdHF1E
"I came to the Queen Mary with my wife and mother in law. We got tickets for the haunted tour where they took us down to the engine room where people had died an accident and we got the story along with sound and smoke effects. It was an enjoyable, if not short, tour. The ship itself is beautiful with long hallways and ornate decorations. You can truly feel the history when you're inside of it. We didn't stay in any of the rooms, although we met my brother in law in a room he was staying, and it was very nice. My only piece of advice would be for taller people like me, to watch your head in the hallways.",ChIJlWtAnNgw3YARNP74lzYz21U
Excellent customer service at the Queen Mary enjoy having dinner at the Sir Winston and also at the Chelsea for lunch love their seafood overall I give the Queen Mary a five star place to stay and indulge and enjoy. Thank You Sonny for your excellent knowledge of the Queen Mary in guiding us and being such a great gentleman. Also the whole crew thank you again for an excellent experience.,ChIJlWtAnNgw3YARNP74lzYz21U
"The Queen Mary is located in the Port of Long Beach in close proximity to the cruise ship terminal. We stayed overnight in a family stateroom on B deck on the starboard side towards the after end of the ship.The ship the onetime star of the Cunard line luxury ships is rich in history and still maintains the service that it was famous for.The room was clean and spacious and surprisingly quiet.The staff was terrific in attending to our request for a tour of the ship and facilitating our tickets for a special event. The Dark Harbor Halloween event. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and plan to attend again in the future.

"This place is a rip off, the room rates are within reason, but they price gouge you for everything else. First you're going to get ripped off with parking (20 dollars a night). Then there's the food... The food is ridiculously over priced, yet it's nothing I'd write home about. The 20 dollar breakfast buffet is no better than the average food quality you'd get at any given Country Kitchen's 9 dollar breakfast buffet.... The 18 dollar spaghetti and meatballs was a joke, one ladle scoop of noodles in some cheap processed tomato sauce, and cheap processed meatballs, and that was it, no sides, no garlic bread, no nothing. The Navy has better food than the over priced garbage they're slinging on this ship, it's highway robbery. Go to a regular hotel that doesn't price gouge their guests, and drive these crooks out of business. I am so pissed at myself for booking a stay at this place.",ChIJlWtAnNgw3YARNP74lzYz21U
"Great hotel! You really feel immersed in 1936 when the ship made its first crossing to New York. It was amazing to see the ship be almost original to its time period. You can walk around the different decks and see and feel the history. The tours of the ship were great too! My mom and I did a Glory Days tour with James - he is phenomenal! This hotel is truly an experience.
The rooms and bathrooms are old, but historical, and very comfortable. The food on ship is good, but very expensive. There is free city bus that comes directly to the Queen Mary and goes to the Shoreline Village (which is a great place to eat and walk around). The bus is great because there is no other food in the area, except on the ship or at Shoreline Village or the Pike.",ChIJlWtAnNgw3YARNP74lzYz21U
"The airport is nice and clean. There is a lot of walking needed to get around in Terminal E, but that's fine. I truly despise places that don't offer free WiFi like this airport. I'm sure there are some restaurants here that offer it but the one I'm sitting in now does not. The number one way to kill time is to browse the Web IMO but now I need to pay for a membership to do so. I'm currently giving JFK this review using their 30 minute  complimentary WiFi access! Make the Internet free and this airport would get my five star review.",ChIJR0lA1VBmwokR8BGfSBOyT-w
"Found Jfk no problem at all, had delay on take off time but still got back to LHR on time? Staff were very helpful and look forward to visiting again. NYC a great experience , if you have'nt been to NYC it's well worth the visit! ",ChIJR0lA1VBmwokR8BGfSBOyT-w
In 06 We missed our flight and got to sleep a night in the halls of the Airport lol. Back in the old days man. It is a huge place . Great ready,ChIJR0lA1VBmwokR8BGfSBOyT-w
"I spent a wonderful and a great time was one of the best airports that I have visited before and it was the best characteristics of customer service is the most important thing I liked the order and cleanliness was the piece something amazing and I'll never forget the great American lines that take care of passenger comfort really was John F. Kennedy Airport the best airport I visited him from Before O'Hare Airport, and also to offer him all my love and my pride Thanks.",ChIJR0lA1VBmwokR8BGfSBOyT-w
I had such a good experience at this spa during a 3 hour layover. I got the gel mani and express pedi treatment with a person whose name I think was Iris. She was lovely and did a great job. The spa is very clean and professional. What a great way to kill time!,ChIJR0lA1VBmwokR8BGfSBOyT-w
"If any of you guys are looking for dirt cheap hotel deals I would check out HotelRaven. Com I saved a ton of money using that site. 

This is my new favorite hotel in Vegas. We had a great time with a very comfortable room. Staff are very friendly and the pool is a sight to behold. I didn't do the Bare as I read it's expensive and not worth it but the free pool is huge and well kept. 

A big shout out to the dealers there. Very friendly and helpful to the customers. This hotel does understand what customer service is. We are already planning our next trip here. ",ChIJdyyk8BXEyIARY72Zdyqd_m0
"We are staying in the Mirage for a conference and all in all the stop has been lovely. There are a few small problems like the WiFi takes a few tries to collect and the walk to the conference rooms is sorta long but other than that it's been great. Our rooms are lovely and it's easy to get around  and find places in the hotel. Also while the buffet is kinda expensive, the food is great!",ChIJdyyk8BXEyIARY72Zdyqd_m0
"Having stayed several places in Las Vegas, the Mirage is our favorite.  The room was spacious and well equipped with technology. I really liked the easy tv plug-ins for attaching external media devices. The hotel location is in short walking distance to other must see attractions and the staff is friendly and helpful.  My wife loved the beds, pillows and sheets. A great place to stay. ",ChIJdyyk8BXEyIARY72Zdyqd_m0

"When I arrived on the 6th things seemed to be going well. I attempted an early check-in but my room wasn't ready yet. Understandable as I was 2 hours early. I was told I would receive a text message with my room number once everything was ready.

I took some time to check my bags with their complimentary luggage service and I ran some errands. I returned around 3:00 pm expecting to receive a text any minute with my room number. I waited a while more and then went to the front desk to see why my room wasn't ready.

The front desk clerk told me my room wasn't ready yet. I had urgent business at 4:30 pm so I expressed this concern and the clerk was able to get me into a room. This was the first problem. My room wasn't ready on time.

I was given a room on the third floor with a scenic view of the room and air conditioning units. Second problem was a crappy view.

I went about my business for the rest of the day. The following morning (on the 7th) I notified the front desk about my door. The door handle is hard to open requiring a significant push and loud crunching noise. I expected this to be fixed by the time I returned late that evening. The door handle is still difficult to open.

The most recent problem happened today the 10th. Housekeeping left the top of a spray nozzle laying across our toothbrushes. This nozzle is from a cleaning bottle and we have no idea what was in the bottle. If they hadn't left the bottle we might have ended up ingesting some kind of poison.

Will most likely choose a different hotel next time.",ChIJdyyk8BXEyIARY72Zdyqd_m0
"We have travelled too many airports all over US and Canada. We have never experienced the goat f**k of finding the car rental place at this airport as a drive up customer . We did not arrive at the airport but we wanted to rent a car from the airport so that we could easily return it to the airport when we left. There are absolutely no signs that say 'car rental',  there are only signs for car rental return. The address given for the car rental hub does not come up on Google Maps or another app we tried to use. Our driver spent the an hour driving around the airport (and around and around) and the interchanges and in the neighborhood surrounding the airport. It was absolutely terrible. It could have been made so easy by having the sign say  ""car rentals AND returns"".",ChIJ7wzsxeFSwokRhvLXxTe087M
"** DO NOT BRING CASH** 
All the bars only take card! You have to order everything on tablets (computer) so there is minimum interaction with the staff which is really a shame as for the most part everyone we spoke to was very helpful. We were advised by the Unite information desk that we could purchase a ""pre paid debit card"" and just put our cash into that which wasn't at all the case. This was of course after being advised in the first instance ""well we live in a digital age""
Ordering food at the food court was for the most part chaotic and again had to be ordered on a tablet. Again the staff were very helpful but we amoung the majority who had no clue how things worked. 
I tried twice to pay at two of the very limited cash points in the food court and neither machine would take my money. I have to say the staff and management dealt with this very well and the manager was very helpful and was kind enough to give me a free drink as compensation for the hassle. 
I would avoid this airport at all costs although I must say the staff were lovely (shame it seems like the idea is to get rid of them and replace with computers) and the train link is really very good and efficient. Much cheaper than taking a taxi! ",ChIJ7wzsxeFSwokRhvLXxTe087M
"Absolute WORST TSA experience ever. I am a frequent traveler and have been to many airports and never have I experienced anything like this. Not only was the priority boarding/Pre-TSA line longer and slower than normal security, the TSA team was screaming and yelling and each other in addition to yelling at me and several other flyers in line. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the people in this line including myself were late for boarding and many of us nearly missed our flights. 

The lack of professionalism at this airport is insane. It is chaotic, there is no order, tons of confusion, and every time we asked for help or assistance we were met with a f**k you attitude and chastised.  ",ChIJ7wzsxeFSwokRhvLXxTe087M
"How can airports be better? EASY! Better roads & signs! All you need is a road for Terminal A, Terminal B, Terminal C, Parking & Exit. How hard is that? No connecting roads where you start off at the right when you come in & immediately have to get to the left, so you cut people off, & vice versa. Who designs these roads?!",ChIJ7wzsxeFSwokRhvLXxTe087M
"Arriving on a United Flight late evening (11:30 PM) with two small children from San Francisco we waited 45 minutes for the bus. When I asked the ticket man why there was no bus as promised every half an hour, his answer was : The bus was standing in front of us and we did not board. This was flat out a lie!!! Three other people did not want to wait so long and took taxis. We have a 3 year old and a five year old and would not take a taxi for security reasons. I think the conductor is working a sideline with the small bus service that approached us to drive us for $ 26.00 per person to New York City. ",ChIJ7wzsxeFSwokRhvLXxTe087M
"Super busy airport, but lots of places to eat and sit while waiting for your flight. There's also plenty of plugs in every aisle which is very helpful.

"I was traveling this morning with my family from SF to DC. The morning was already a little stressful while towing along 4 children about 6am when we got to the security checkpoint. A man whose name I was told is Al, was extremely rude. My husband used the electronic tickets on his phone, and for some reason it would not show my youngest daughters lap ticket. He started with an attitude like I was stupid saying that human trafficking happens all the time etc. while we were trying to figure out what we needed to do he was impatient and would not answer any questions. I said she has a ticket my husband will run and get it - meanwhile I am already annoyed by his no reason attitude - I asked if my children and I could wait off to the side until my husband got back with the ticket so we didn't have to fight with the kids to go all the way back then back again with all our luggage. He said no, you can not stay right here, this isn't a hotel. At that point I'm looking at him with a WTF stare because I am so baffled by his demeanor and what he said...especially the way he was acting as an airport employee and in front of my children. He stares right back at me with a jerk stare and smug smile... I said you could be a little more accommodating or nicer and he shrugged without breaking that smug stare and muttered a few other rude things I can't recall. He made me very upset. I still can't believe the way we were treated by him. I was so offended...is this normal behavior of an airport employee in SF? I've flown through many airports and was never treated so crudely. It left a really bad taste in my mouth on my first time flying out of SF. ",ChIJVVVVVYx3j4ARP-3NGldc8qQ

"One of the few ""historical"" places in the area, although it's been renovated and Disneyland-ified quite a bit. Entrance is very expensive for what you'll see (~$40). The guided tour was OK, but you can see they're in a rush and give the same speech and jokes to everyone, 10 times a day. No pictures inside (for $40, what did you expect).

They're isn't much ""mystery"", it's just an old lady with no architecture experience who designed a home as she was living in it. Not much consistency, a lot of mistakes, but an interesting result nonetheless.",ChIJjzp2WN7Kj4ARZu9lBAGmS2Q
Interesting; quirky.  Fun place to see.  The tour guides are knowledgeable.  Their script includes too many attempts at humor that's only mildly funny and rather unnecessary.  The history and facts are interesting enough to stand on their own.,ChIJjzp2WN7Kj4ARZu9lBAGmS2Q
"My husband and I visited the Winchester mansion today August 22, 2015. I'm writing this review to let everyone know that at $36 per person, this could be accurately categorized as a royal rip off. 
The tour lasting approximately 65 minutes, was like taking a tour of a construction site. I feel like the people who bought this house to allow the public to see the madness Mrs Winchester suffered, are suffering themselves from insanity by thinking that this is entertainment or interesting.
I have toured old homes before and as I did, I felt a strong respect for my surroundings. This place is a big joke. Most of it is not roped off allowing the public to put their hands all over everything. Some of the mars in the interior are obviously from visitors completely disrespecting this house by touching the walls and counters, doors and cabinets. Most of it is in shambles with the majority of the rooms being totally empty. The ones which are not, are filled with furniture which was never owned by Mrs Winchester. It is more than apparent that the current owners of the Winchester mansion are not interested in preserving the massive mansion but only interested in stealing money from they public by claims of odd construction, (which there is but not to the extent portrayed on the website).
Her ""favorite niece"" should be ashamed of herself for allowing this mockery of the family name.
The one enjoyable part of this place were the grounds. Beautifully kept, they are an enticing facade to a disappointing mess inside! People read reviews for a reason, to see others' opinions of a product etc. If a couple post negative reviews, i feel they could just be negative people. But many people said the same thing i experienced today. I wish I had listened to the many people who feel the same way as we do. We'd be $72 richer.

"Hoooooorrible service from rude and lazy workers. Lack of clear signs and the immigration and ""customs"" lines were terrible.

"This has to be the most unprofessional airport ever! We had to fly here in order to get home via United. United was great. But the airport was terrible. The TSA officers there are rude, sarcastic, and mean. The one directing us to get in line was throwing comments how ""we can't follow instructions"" ""we're losing their time"". The lady working the x ray where our bags passed by had the biggest attitude ever. She gave smirks and spoke under her breath. And all the officers there were joking around and laughing while doing their job! Like the security of our country is in your hands show some professionalism and some seriousness! Off to luggage.. The guys are the luggage didn't even look like they worked there. They had normal causal clothes, and they didn't even know what they were doing. I had asked them where I should put it and he responded ""oh man I don't know"" and walked away laughing. Then some other guy directed us to a luggage line. When I got there that lady was worse. When I asked her a question about the line she just pointed to the board. She looked pissed, bored, and like she just didn't care. That's when everything ended and we got on our plane to Philly. Houston Airport needs to step up their game. Their employees are a joke. If they need to be taking seriously they need to hire professional people. This all happened to be when I flew in from Guadalajara Mexico to Houston on Jan 5, 2015 via United. I arrived around 5 pm. We're planning on going to Mexico and our family is stopping in Atlanta. Houston was a terrible experience, especially for us who were first time flyers!!",ChIJx1VD2SO0QIYRMcLAyPy0xpw

"Logan is outdated, inefficient and requires customer service 101.  The international arrival process through customs is particularly unbearable because you are jet lagged and have to wait in a line to queue up for another three lines before you can make it to an exit for the baggage calim and bathroom.  Heaven forbid someone walks off with your luggage because no one verified baggage tags with ticket holders.  ",ChIJN0na1RRw44kRRFEtH8OUkww
"I hate Logan because it is probably the least-safe that I ever feel at an airport.  The security is an absolute joke.  You would think that they would take things a bit more seriously.

"I frequently pick up family and friends at the Logan Airport Terminal E. For the past 3 visits to the airport, I've had to wait due to flight delays and I needed to use the restrooms. Oh no! It's impossible to find a clean stall, they are not properly maintained. 
I notified the Airport information desk nearby to see if they could send someone to take care of it, they didn't seem to care and did nothing. 
After flying into Logan and before driving off almost everybody makes a stop to the restroom, what a great first impression of our beautiful country. Come on Logan airport. Please keep Terminal E Arrival restrooms tidy.
I wanted to contact the airport, or Massport but finding a contact email was impossible.",ChIJN0na1RRw44kRRFEtH8OUkww
"I frequently travel to and from Logan from Canada and this has largely coloured my experience of this airport. If you fly in on Porter look forward to a long delay waiting at immigration (over an hour and a half in one case though that was before I got NEXUS), if you fly on Air Canada things are seamless enough on the way in but on your way out be aware that the gates (B1,2,3) are separate from the gate area for the rest of the terminal.

This means among other things once you go through security for these gates there are no food options other than a very basic coffee cart type setup which more often than not is out of food and typically serving up coffee that has been sitting there for hours. The area is also quite small and becomes extremely crowded in the late afternoon/evenings when most people are flying out - it also gets very hot in there. There is also only the one small bathroom to cater to the hordes of people in here (1 urinal and 1 stall in the men's, based on where they are situated I can't imagine the women's bathroom is any larger).

Possibly the most frustrating thing about this situation is knowing that the other gate area for the US domestic flights from this terminal is right next door and has plenty of food options but you can't get to it using a ticket associated with the Air Canada gates. Additionally for those with AIr Canada or star alliance status there is a United lounge at Logan but, you guessed it, you can't get to that either. There is some desk space with power to setup a laptop and/or charge your devices but due to the crowding getting access to these is hit and miss.

All in all there is not much you can do about any of this if you want to get from Boston to Toronto, Ottawa, or Montreal (as I mentioned above the Porter option has its downsides as well) but the one recommendation I would give people is do not pass through security to the gates until you have to. In the non-airside portion of the terminal there are at least *some* food options (albeit primarily a Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and a fairly ordinary restaurant called Oasis), larger washrooms if you want to freshen up, and at least some space to move around.

I did see a claim in an earlier review that there is work underway to address some of these issues at Logan but to be honest I haven't seen any indication of this in the couple of years I've been travelling in and out of this airport and can't imagine how they would do anything about many of them without investing in a full re-design and renovation of this end of the terminal or Air Canada moving to another location in the airport entirely. Oh and as I am forced to switch to tethering data from my phone to post this I'm reminded that I almost forgot, the Boingo wifi absolutely sucks (and this is after choosing the paid option). I'm not sure if this specific to Terminal B or more general but I've used it both air-side and pre-security and never had much luck with it.",ChIJN0na1RRw44kRRFEtH8OUkww
Top notch hotel! Beautiful decor tastefully done. Parasol Down bar with hourly 'show' from about 7.30pm. Casino nicely spaced and gaming Croupiers very helpful. Restaurants and bars plentiful. We stayed in a room overlooking the golf course (our choice) - the rooms are large and luxurious with electronically controlled draperies including blackout and very well equipped. The pool area also very nice. My husband played the golf course which he said was well worth the money and the caddy was very helpful and knowledgeable. The down side? None that I can think of! Would definitely recommend and definitely return.,ChIJlYYq3iLEyIAR7W-7y3M7wbE

"Decor is gorgeous and very but service is the worst of any 5-star hotel. I took my parents here and we had to wait in line for 20mins just to check in. Also, they didn't bother coming by to service our room. At 2pm I had to notify service room, and by 3:30pm, they still weren't there yet. At that time, I had to call Front Desk and Housekeeping before someone came by our room. Don't waste your money, I'm not bringing any of my guests here ever again. I would rather stay at any 5-star hotel here in Las Vegas and receive much better service. 

Management of this hotel should be held to higher standard because they obviously failed here.",ChIJlYYq3iLEyIAR7W-7y3M7wbE

"I'm a local, and write this with the hope that somebody who reads it might actually have the power to change things. I love the Wynn properties and wish they would stop doing things to alienate good customers.

I played poker there pretty much daily starting with the opening of the room a decade ago. Somewhere around 2009 the staff became brutal and antagonistic, presumably due to the economy and firings, etc. A lot of locals (me included) left for other cardrooms and the Wynn poker room became a ghost town.

Fast forward to this year. After several years of playing mostly at Aria, I decided to give the Wynn another shot. Pleasant surprise: the staff is now excellent and friendly. But here's where the trouble starts.

At any other property in Vegas, there is either dedicated motorcycle parking, or you can park in the weird in-between spots that won't fit a car. Wynn offers neither, and ridiculously threatens to tow you if you park a motorcycle in striped areas. This despite the fact that you're doing them a favor and not taking up a car space!

For my own part, I don't like parking in a wide open space because the bike is highly visible to thieves. I tried to speak to security about the issue; they had me fill out a form and then never called me back. Surprise: two weeks later my motorcycle gets stolen. Never so much as an acknowledgment from the Wynn.

Maybe at some point the Wynn will decide its efforts are better spent protecting good customers instead of hassling them and ignoring them. In the meantime I'll be parking and playing elsewhere.",ChIJlYYq3iLEyIAR7W-7y3M7wbE
"The information at this airport is ridiculous at Southwest ticket counter. Been here for 4 hrs and the info monitor says 'boarding' but there is no information on the flight. The attendants dont make announcements for delayed flights and expect you to wait in long lines to get basic and simple information. Bathrooms at airport in a Southwest terminal are horribly messy and dirty. Bad experience and with such lack of attention to guests is very unfortunate. This airport and the Southwest part of it needs training and a complete overhaul to their customer service and relations.  Very disappointed with the entire experience.

"Why are the terminals not connected?!  If you added one to the other you would think that you should have added a walk way to connect them.  Very glaring omission and shortsighted.  Good selection of restaurants however as always, you will pay higher than by eating out in town.  And like all other airport shopping, way overpriced (price gouging I thought was frowned upon in todays society), make sure you have everything.  Same exact earbuds I got somewhere else for 4.99 cost 16.99 there.  Maybe that will help pay for the new walk way between terminals.",ChIJ7-bxRDmr3oARawtVV_lGLtw
"Loved the style of The Cosmopolitan. We had an amzing suite with the best veiw.

I stayed there for my wedding and on the morning of my wedding we were at the buffet and they wouldnt put us on a table next to my friends who were already eating unless we agreed to pay a service charge because the party was bigger than 10! It was a buffet and we werent with the others! Thats just one of many times we were treated poorly.

"This airport has the RUDEST staff!!  They yell at the passengers-giving orders in an unnecessary tone and do not offer any assistance. The security checkpoint would move a lot faster if the plastic bins were accessible at the beginning of this area instead of being stacked high on the opposite side. The luggage was handled poorly and being ""thrown"" onto the conveyor.  This airport needs to be more selective in who they hire and should definitely have mandatory classes for all of their employees to teach about customer service and ""how to be polite"".

"This is the world's busiest airport and all airports should be created in this format. A train/subway takes you to all the terminals and gates. You can always walk on the walkway systems, but the trains make it easy and quick to go from an International terminal to a domestic terminal. Baggage claim is easy and quick and there are ALWAYS so many helpful people to help and educate people in this huge airport, which reminds me of a train station overseas. 

If I have a choice between this and one of the other major airports, I would always choose ATL.",ChIJAVkD4S_99IgRSLCSGO-jF0E
"I have been flying through the Atlanta airport for decades now, as well as many others, in the US and international, so I have some basis for comparison. First of all, I've tried to normalize this review to the fact that this is an airport - it is not a restaurant, hotel, or somewhere you go to relax, so I don't rank it that way. Secondly, I try to separate my feelings about airlines (Delta) from the airport, as they are separate entities. That said, there are other airports that do a better job of being a pleasant environment. In general, I dread going through Atlanta, just due to the sheer volumes of flights and humanity - that is my biggest complaint, that the seating areas and spaces in general can't handle the volumes of passengers passing through them. However, in fairness I have to say they do pretty well at moving folks along, providing shops and amenities, are improving access to outlets in seating areas, etc. Finally, the big complaint that prompted this review, is that I spent six hours in Hartsfield yesterday (delay due to Delta, not the aiport's problem) and was roasting in the terminal due to air conditioning problems! Atlanta was probably a premier airport when it was built, but volumes have increased since then and it can't seem to keep up. I avoid it when I can.",ChIJAVkD4S_99IgRSLCSGO-jF0E
"I never write reviews but I feel like I need to now. I wish I could put 0 stars. This airport has the rudest employees I have ever met. We travelled internationally yesterday and they are so unnessicarily mean to people that come through security/customs. They YELL at people travelling. They joke/scream at each other and then blame us that the line is too slow. They belittle all human beings. Just because you hate your job does not mean you have to take it out on clients. Travel days are stressful already, and it doesn't help when airport employees are rude, unhelpful and unapproachable. I will go out of my way to never come to this airport again.

"It's a giant loopy mess of a hole. Construction never ends at the terminals with garages partially closed and the terminal drop off / pick up areas in complete shambles littered with barriers and equipment.  As a regular individual making a drop off or pick up you will almost NEVER get a curbside spot to pull up. They literally have 2 spaces for individuals. All of the rest are reserved for 'pre-arranged limo', 'shared ride {shuttles/bus}', and taxis. On top of this- there is no nearby lot to pull off so that you can wait until the person is ready to be picked up. The loops for pulling into a terminal are a god-forsaken mess with lanes crossing each other and lines trying to get into a terminal and out of a terminal in the very same spot, with each waiting on the other to be courteous enough to let the other go.  Horrible architecture and road layout. It is too busy to be this poorly designed. Forget about getting in and out of the airport property. They have designed several major highways to cross both north and south of the airport which causes severe backup. ",ChIJpyoiDWYqTIYRHCB9Bl4_MnM
"Here is our experience at the Dallas Fort Worth Airport Dollar Rental. This was my worst experience ever with a rental car company. I so wish I would've looked at Yelp before renting there, it's obvious this place is a nightmare. It started off with a super rude lady at the rental counter. Then we were given keys and had to wander around trying to find a vehicle. Eventually did and drove off without thinking twice. We drove the car for 5 days like normal and went to take it back. As we pulled up the ""inspector"" looks closely at the hood and side panel and finds dents that we'd neither caused or ever seen before. He claims that we'd caused them and would have to pay. We freaked out because we know nothing we experienced during the week would've caused them and he said not to worry about it. So we got on our flight and didn't think about it again until last week. Here we are 3 months later and they say we owe them $900 for the dent repair.  

Also, this airport is a nightmare. It is so freaking huge it is impossible to navigate. My GPS goes haywire within 5 miles of it. Also, they've lost our bags like half the time.

"Note to self...never....ever...EVER fly with American Airlines ever again! Here's my reasons why:
1. they give you the option to purchase flight insurance, as does every other airline. Little do they tell you THEY DONT EVEN HONOR OR DEAL WITH FLIGHT INSURANCE. 25 dollars down the drain. 
2. Hotel checkout was at 10am... My flight isn't until 5pm (they didn't let me choose my flight times for arrival to NYC...messed up).
3. I approached FIVE American airline desk to explain the fact that I'm here already at the airport and if there was anyway I can get on standby for the next flight... I got FIVE different excuses as to why I can't get on standby. Including they don't do standby (completely bull because I missed my flight on Thursday morning and got put on standby) 
4. I was told that my ticket was restricted and there was nothing I could do to ever change it. 
5. I was told I could change it.... For $80. To a flight that had 2 stops... Why on Gods green earth would I pay money to have a flight with MULTIPLE stops when the one I have is direct? 
6. If you look up RUDE in the dictionary, there's a BIG picture of American Airline affiliates.

"The best way of describing LGA is ""you pay peanuts, you get a monkey"". LGA has very very cheap flights, which is its main highlight. however obviously, in order to be is cheap they have to make concessions and cut spending, with the result the terminal is a bit grubby. But hey, that's why you're paying much less.

It has a somewhat boring design and each concourse has a different security barrier, meaning you should eat before screening.  Food choices aren't very good either.  But the Delta terminal is much nicer and newer.  Public transportation is not the fastest making the airport seem farther than it really is, although the MTA has improved access by making the M60 a SBS route and starting the Q70.

This was not satisfactory as we were in NYC to do some sight seeing in Manhattan and enjoy staying near Times Square. So the search continued. Soon after that, a family of 3 came into the hotel and were given a room immediately. So much for having no rooms available.

"This airport is the worst in the 40 years I have traveled into and out of in the U.S. I arrived at an E gate. I walked and walked and walked to the baggage claim area. With people movers it still took 20 minutes to get to baggage claim. I was not walking at a slow pace either. Flying out of the airport is also a nightmare. Received my boarding pass and of course another E gate nightmare walk but good news I had TSA precheck. I thought it was good news until I went to security and was told I HAD to go to either the B security check in or the E security check in. I was in the middle so it was another walk to get to the security check points. Went to E and despite having a TSA precheck I had to take off my shoes and jacket, according to the tsa agent I had to regardless of my boarding pass status. Also had to go through the body scanner which normally you aren't required to do that either. I was the only passenger in this security check point since it was 6 am and not a lot of people at the airport at that hour. Then of course another mile walk to my gate. I would avoid this airport and I will in the future. This is just a nightmare not to mention the rude employees at this airport. ",ChIJidRKt32YVogRN6fEPG9Kuho
"I love connecting through Charlotte. The airport is relatively small, but overall easy to navigate even with the amount of people that go there. TSA is thorough (sometimes it takes a while) and friendly. Connecting through this airport is a breeze. Flights usually don't get delayed, I've even flown out in a big thunderstorm right on time. I would recommend connecting through CLT if you have the chance as it is one of the best.",ChIJidRKt32YVogRN6fEPG9Kuho
"Worst airport on planet Earth. Arrived on 10th September to get connecting flight to London Heathrow. Flight delayed for 5hrs due to the aircraft being: late in arriving, broken down and being repaired, bad weather(which I can agree with due to heavy thunderstorms) and several other feeble excuses. The staff who we spoke to were either rude unhelpful or generally not interested in assisting customers 

No one from the airport or airline US Airways/American Airlines kept anyone informed of what was happening no refreshments were offered in fact the service was terrible.

To make matters worse when we eventually arrived home we found that both our cases were soaking wet through having been left out on the tarmac for 5hrs in the rain waiting to be loaded onto the aircraft so most of the contents being ruined. 

My wife even received insect bites in the departure lounge. 

This airport for being an international Airport is simply pathetic!!",ChIJidRKt32YVogRN6fEPG9Kuho
The lobby that connects all the terminals likings super nice. There is a guy playing Jazzy tunes on a mini grand next to a bar. I love that this airport has so many walkways that get you faster to where you need to go. ,ChIJidRKt32YVogRN6fEPG9Kuho

Where Treasure Island is located is so easy to access and it makes the experience much more enjoyable. Being easy to spot as well as a lot of people being there makes it fun.

Well appointed rooms that do not feel out of date, friendly staff, good location. I would recommend it. ",ChIJswuaqjrEyIARE0cTvGmUiwk
Mystere Show was AMAZING and jaw dropping the entire show!!!! Hotel nothing spectacular. Nice rooms and decent restaurants on site. Nothing over the top very simple. Close proximity to the dancing water and volcano eruptions. VERY DISAPPOINTED they no longer have the pirate show. ,ChIJswuaqjrEyIARE0cTvGmUiwk
"We reserved our room thru Expedia as a non smoking double bed room. However, after waiting 20 minutes in line, when we checked in, they said all they have is smoking rooms left! We already paid so couldn't cancel so we endured the smoking odor in the room and hallways. I don't get why you would over book rooms when you have paid reservations. Also the Coffee House's pho was okay.  It was a large portion and the broth smelled right but the beef tenders didn't taste fresh.",ChIJswuaqjrEyIARE0cTvGmUiwk
"The only reason it got 1 star was because I can't put 0 stars. 0 stars is the only way to truly display the service I have received at this airport: 0 service. I landed at this airport at 11:00 pm and my bag wasn't at the baggage claim. There was absolutely no one that worked at the airport that could tell me how I could get my bag back. When I called the customer support line from their information phone, the person who answered immediately gave me attitude and acted like ""how dare I call her and ask for assistance."" If there is any way to get around from using this airport, I would highly recommend everyone to do so. You will avoid a massive headache and irritating situation by doing so.",ChIJL4OpYGbExokR2NM3RpQVLj4
"Not just an ordinary failure, but an exemplary failure. In the age of social media, when you fail badly, you can record it, upload it to YouTube, and enjoy a fleeting moment of celebrity status.  Philly's airport design is an epic failure, but without the infamy it deserves. I hope I can play a small part in changing that. Yes, you're guaranteed endless lines at security that wrap in such a way that you think you have arrived at the front of the line only to realize that was a cruel trick and now you have to walk back right to where you started, but that's nothing special. No, the crowning glory here is you have to get on a bus to access the F terminal. It's as if someone built the terminal and said, damn...I forgot that passengers need some way to access the terminal. Well, I guess they can just get on a bus that will drive around the runway until it gets to terminal F. If Idiocracy is a prophecy, this is the airport of the future.",ChIJL4OpYGbExokR2NM3RpQVLj4
"I live near Philly and this is practically the only airport I can get direct flights to the cities in the west. Very good airport but it is starting to show signs of the airport reaching full capacity during a regular routine scheduled day. Security is a little rough on you but it does ware off after you go through the checkpoint. Terminals are surprisingly clean although a little spots that need some touch up. I'll give some advice for someone coming through this airport do not get caught up in any restaurant unless you enough time to eat. And also this , if you have an early flight scheduled get their EARLY because I'll bet you a long line at security and one last thing, if you not want to experience what goes on in Philly international then I suggest using Lehigh Valley international near Allentown or if you wanna make the ride, also use Harrisburg international to not get caught up .",ChIJL4OpYGbExokR2NM3RpQVLj4

"he most disgusting hotel i'v ever been in.
noise all over from construction- the guy on front desk say that they can do that from 9am!!- WTF???
wi fi connecction was so bad that we need to call front desk every 5 min.
water flow was slow that the shoers seem for ever
dont ever go there .
very bad hotel.
well i dont think the its a hote",ChIJX44S6a1ZwokRvIWf4R_fdiI
"The hotel is clean and many areas have recently been updated. 

Here's my one major gripe: unfortunately, the WiFi requests social media details in order to use it - which I find unnecessary and creepy: this gives the hotel a very easy way to track our activity. Even once signed in, the connection was terrible - to the point where images aren't loading. I am not able to load simple applications for work, and given that this is a work trip, this makes things very frustrating. At night, we tried to open Netflix. Absolutely no success there. 

If you're going to be so blatantly creepy and invasive, at least offer a decent service in return. And in this age, it is not acceptable to not offer a functional internet connection.",ChIJX44S6a1ZwokRvIWf4R_fdiI
"This place has vibe and I like the proximity to the Javits. Free wifi, the Tick Tock Diner is excellent, and I've never had any real issues in the 3 stays I've had over the years. The shower does fluctuate hot and cold pretty badly, only quirk I dislike.",ChIJX44S6a1ZwokRvIWf4R_fdiI
"They put us in a room next to the room where they had a construction, so there was unbearable noise. 
Next they moved is in a room with wrong bed size.
Third room, next day, at 6.50 in the morning construction noise woke us up. 
Morning after, construction noise woke us again!
It was 4.July. Couldn't they delay their construction?!
They didn't want to admit that had a construction at all.
I complained without success to who know how many managers, to GM, to Wyndham latter...",ChIJX44S6a1ZwokRvIWf4R_fdiI
"Nice Hotel! Enjoyed my stay here but one thing really bothered me and my sister during our stay here. Her designer shoes got missing from the room and it is possible it was thrown away by housekeeping not stolen but when we reported the loss to the hotel, they sent someone over claiming they will investigate it. We never heard anything back from them and its been a month. We reached out severally and no one ever contacted us. What a shame! 

",ChIJX44S6a1ZwokRvIWf4R_fdiI
"I like the look of the outside and the theme that is made to look like but once you go inside and in your room there is no more medieval theme at all just plan uniform colors and carpets as all the hallways and other room areas. The room I was assigned was facing he back of the hotel with a wonderful view of the roof with AC units and parking garage. The pool is very nice with a bar and areas to relax and enjoy or take a dip in the water as well. Most of the places to eat are fast food companies and not much else.
Its not bad but could be a better experience and you do get a reasonable rate for the rooms too",ChIJzZtJhM3FyIAR6eHpF4xTR68
"The smell is unbearable. Definitely nothing fancy or classy. Old, dirty, smelly hotel with nasty carpet. The restaurant choices were awful. Smokiest casino in all of Las Vegas. I feel like we overpaid for what we got. I would recommend paying a few extra bucks and getting something better and further down the strip. There was nothing to do at this far / older end of the strip. Water slide pool was closed which made for a very crowed pool area. By the end of our stay I was gagging walking through the hotel - combination of heavy perfumed air fresheners mixed with smoke. We had a non-smoking room but no one cares and smokes anyways. Guest freely smoke weed and cigarettes throughout the halls and elevate. UGH! ",ChIJzZtJhM3FyIAR6eHpF4xTR68
"Booked requesting non smoking, was given a smoking room. The stench of cigarettes and Marijuana wafted into the room all night. Room was cleaned poorly and is incredibly outdated. Looks like a cheap motel but at 10x the price. The next day, they moved me to a non smoking room thankfully, but the decor is still dated, cracks on the bathroom tile, etc. ",ChIJzZtJhM3FyIAR6eHpF4xTR68
"I loved the Tournament of Kings show. My favorite thing in Las Vegas of all time. The people that took us there didn't tell us about the $50 resort fee,but it was TOTALLY worth the 4 days we were there. Everything was clean,the rooms smelled good,and the staff was very friendly. The restaurants were awesome. It's the ONLY place I want to stay while I'm in LV. If I want to go horseback riding,race dune buggies,or go drive a real NASCAR at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, they'll just send someone to the front door.
So,Excaliber,all I have to say is.....HAAZZZAAAAAHH !!!!!!!!  ??",ChIJzZtJhM3FyIAR6eHpF4xTR68
"DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Terrible place, location on the strip is good. Rooms dirty and dated. Staff is not helpful nor friendly. My husband and I got some rash from the linens on our face, totally grossed out. Like the other review, useless resort fee... While we wanted a bargain, we didn't bargain for this.

"Such an amazing experience! Lots to see and lots of walking. Make sure you get a map and see the marked  famous and well known artists/paintings.

Although the artwork was amazing to see the staff was incredibly rude. I would not recommend someone to visit here. I saw a security guard yelling at a women who did not speak English and could not understand what he was saying while he patronized her. When the museum closed I was separated from my family and they literally pushed me out the door and would not give me information as to where I was exiting so I could find my family. Blown away with how the staff there treats visitors. ,ChIJSYxSO5u3t4kRm4eyKw_Y7Kg

The Paul Cezzane gallery is most definitely a highlight. Great traveling exhibitions can be found here, as well. My last visit they displayed some great metal points; including da Vinci's ""Bust of a Warrior"" and they also had Peter Paul Ruben's Magi reunited for the first time in 130 years. World class collection.",ChIJSYxSO5u3t4kRm4eyKw_Y7Kg
"This park rivals Death Valley in heat, particularly in the cactus field. I enjoyed some of the rock formations, and the Joshua trees had an interesting shape, but I would have appreciated more signs/maps/infographics explaining features about the park. As for wildlife, I glimpsed a bat, jackrabbit and a few lizards. Watch out for bees that swarm toward cars with air conditioning. Stay for the sunset though! The trails are not particularly easy, so pick one or two and that should be sufficient to get a general view of the park (I went to Hidden Valley).",ChIJe6hluYWP2oAR4p3rOqftdxk
"If you're into nature, you'll have to feast your eyes on this place.  It is one of the most interesting parks I've seen.  The rock formations are spectacular.  If you can stay for a sunset, the views are awesome.  Make sure you bring plenty of water and your vehicle is full of gas.  There's an entrance fee of $20/day and well worth it.  

Just be aware that there is no shade during the day.",ChIJe6hluYWP2oAR4p3rOqftdxk
"I came in 8 pm, and climbed a huge rock formation, we waited for the sun to go down, to see the stars. The sky was clear, so we were really hyped. As it got closer to 9:30, the stars did not dissapoint. The night sky was so clear, we could see the faint misty clouds of the milky way galaxy ark across from west to east. Definitly would go again",ChIJe6hluYWP2oAR4p3rOqftdxk

From the complete abstract to the sublime artistic expressions of some of the best painters on earth. This modern art museum is for the whole family and can take the better part of a day to explore. You know their art collection is vast when there is a Minecraft display. The big apple on a pedestal sums up the museum; sophisticatedly elegant. ,ChIJKxDbe_lYwokRVf__s8CPn-o
"This museum has no leadership.  The exhibit ?Looking East? was there after stops in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Kyoto.  Included in the exhibit were kimonos ? lent by a Japanese company - that were replicas of the one in Monet?s ?La Japonaise?.  This was a thoughtful gesture by the Japanese that gave Americans a chance to get a hands on experience sharing in the beautiful Japanese culture.

But the museum insulted the Japanese after their generous offer by cancelling the try-on event because a handful of non-Japanese protested.  The MFA also monitored ?social media?.  As if a handful of protesters and the usual nuts in the blogosphere should decide what the rest of us get to see and do.  And as if these non-Japanese know what is offensive to the Japanese better than the Japanese do.

If the MIA had looked into exactly who these protesters were, they would have seen that they?re sociopathic.  The perpetually-aggrieved type who define themselves by who they hate.  They jump on any and every counter-culture cause and use it as a pretense to vent their deep rooted hatreds ? which in this case, appeared to be white people, men, and the Japanese.

Unbelievable that the MIA would disregard the Japanese and everyone else and cave to a few freaks.

"This should be called ""the world's most expensive arena"".  That is how costly a night at The Garden can be.  Beware of the upper deck seats.  They are above the ozone layer.  The Garden is a historic venue.  A music act knows they hit the big time when they headline The Garden.  When the Knicks have a good team watching them is very exciting.  They also host some great college basketball games.  Hockey is okay, but not really my bag.  If I was interested in hockey I would definitely want to see the Rangers play at The Garden.  It would sure beat seeing the Devils play in Newark.

The current Knicks aggregate resembles a minor league team.  I can't believe they charge full price for tickets to see them play.  I pray to God that Isiah Thomas never returns to the Knicks in any capacity.  He shouldn't even be allowed to set foot in the city of New York.  Phil Jackson isn't much better.

"Probably the worst hotel I've been to. I've been to a lot from 2 star to 5 star. I'll try to be brief.

Pros: Location. It's right between the Aquarium, Georgia Dome, and Phillips Arena. If you don't mind walking it's pretty close to Hard Rock Cafe as well. 

Front Desk. The gentleman was very pleasant and nice. 

Cons: No better way to set the mood than to be told you have to pay a Mandatory $35 Valet fee. The valet attendant seemed accustomed to being asked why such a high charge. His reply was rather smug and condescending. He told me I could go park 2 blocks away but his tone was ""if you want to be cheap go park on the street and get your car broken into"". Pissed me off. 

The room. Keep in mind that this was a short getaway for my wife and I anniversary. We really just wanted a good room to spend time together and find some good eats. The first issue we had was the TV. The TV did not work correctly. It kept losing signal to a movie we both was into (""Duplex"") and we kept missing 5 min chunks. Then when we woke up to leave I wanted to take a shower. Our tub was stopped up so i took a shower bath in a foot of water. Valet again. When I got to valet it was a guy there that waited 10 or so mins. They couldn't locate his car. The lady (not that it matters but rather attractive) that seemed to be the leader of the group was not apologetic at all. The guys retrieving the cars had people waiting as they just held people keys and talked to each other. I waited about 7 mins. 

Overall, I will not go there again. Great location and only good if you don't plan to be there in the room. Maybe a good spot if you sharing room with friends for a football or basketball game. Let's not forget the $50 deposit they don't tell you about until you check in. I was using a credit card so why the need for a deposit? Just horrible. ",ChIJd_c_Y4AD9YgR0xH3kBPHKqI

When staying in the hotel, our room had a terrible view (contrary to the website photos), only 2 elevators worked and we waited for an hour to take an elevator up to our room. At the end of our stay we were charged an extra $35 for parking and multiple other charges for state and hotel charges; bringing our total to $232...

When we bought our ticket (with stroller in hand) the guy sold us the more expensive one for full access and 3D movie. He said ""movies play throughout the day and last one is about half hour before closing"". Had no idea we only had one time slot ""throughout the day"" so we missed that. All special exhibits do not allow strollers, so we had to carry our screaming one year old and run through them as fast as possible and basically missed them all. If they had told us when we checked in that strollers are not allowed in the exhibit we would not have spent the extra money. If not for that - would be 5 stars...when we asked why strollers were not allowed they said that there are too many people, do they realize how hard it is to chase a one year old around when there is more people that you have to get around to catch him? If I had known that I would have brought the backpack carrier to keep him in! He writes quietly and peacefully in the stroller, but when he's not he wants to run around!",ChIJV0AwM30rDogR2sd-X0cgErU
"It is SO big! I was amazed at the size of the museum! It would take a week to see all the exhibits and shows. Our tickets got us into all the special exhibits and a 3D show. Although we didn't have any kid with us, there were plenty of activities for children. Some exhibits were more text heavy, so we adults learned something as well. I wish we had dedicated more time to see everything.

"UPDATE: Returning flight after the previous experience below was even worse. I had not touched my behind to my seat (early boarding because of my leg) than a flight attendant jumped in behind me insisting that my dog carrier needed to be under the seat fully. Yes flight attendant, I know that. How about you let me sit down (BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE IS EVEN ON THE PLANE MIND YOU) and hand the cane I needed to walk today to my fiance, before I cram my poor ESA under the seat. It was like we landed in California and all compassion and common sense left the building. Way to top yourself LAX.

-----

They have multiple in terminal shuttles, however it's still a major pain to navigate between terminals. Often you end up undergound in stuffy tunnels. I, having a cane but no disability placard, was often ignored by the in terminal shuttle drivers, who actually gave a seat to a middle aged man because I was younger.",ChIJtU-yE9KwwoAR8a2LaVd7qHc
"ONE open security terminal, literally no where to eat.  One Starbucks with 50+ people in line.  One ""bakery"" that ran out of food at 5am.  Bathrooms are deplorable- haven't been cleaned in weeks? Literally waited to get on the plane to go pee.  This place is a joke. An announcement was made that they were looking for spongebob squarepants.  Really?  I will avoid this place like the plague next time I come to California.  

Almost forgot the relentless beeping while sitting at the gate waiting to board.  Splitting headache before boarding. Fun. ",ChIJtU-yE9KwwoAR8a2LaVd7qHc
"I flew into LAX on a Wednesday and out on a Saturday morning and was impressed by the speed in which I was able to check into my JetBlue flight from the curb AND make my way through the airport. For such a huge city, the airport itself is a bit dated, specifically, terminal seating, the luggage ramps and overall decor. Be sure to ask your driver to bring you past the iconic LAX letters or lit columns for a fun photo op.

Transportation tip: You can get an Uber Black but not an Uber X from the main terminal.",ChIJtU-yE9KwwoAR8a2LaVd7qHc
"Have transferred through LAX numerous times for trans-Pacific flights and would rather take a different airport if I could for one simple reason: transferring from one terminal to another is a pain in the rear that's disgraceful for an international airport of this size and importance. If you're transferring from one airline to another you typically will have to exit one terminal entirely, walk some distance, wait an eternity for one of the few transfer buses to come by, then have to go through security yet again at the next terminal even if you're already checked through to your next flight. I've flown through many airports all over the US and in other countries and it's ludicrous that LAX doesn't have a shuttle service that doesn't require you to exit security to catch your next flight.
On my last experience with LAX I had to transfer from the International terminal to the one for American. Not knowing which of the terminals was American's I asked the bus driver and he ended up taking me to Terminal 7. I tried to confirm he had the right terminal after seeing United signs on the building and he made the excuse that the signs said American further down. After disembarking and finding out he was wrong I waited a long time for another bus to come by and it turned out to be the same driver. Instead of apologizing, the jerk actually tried to turn it around and say he had said Terminal 4 but I INSISTED it was this one. Needless to say I lost my temper and berated him at that point. All I can say is that he was an a$$. I can understand making an honest mistake but to then try and blame it on the person you wronged is just pathetic.
LAX needs to get its act together.",ChIJtU-yE9KwwoAR8a2LaVd7qHc
"Horrible, absolutely horrible. Filled with rude, uncaring a**holes that laugh at the simplest of things that a first time flyer like my husband had gone through on his own after having already gone through a nightmare at a departing airport with US airways prior to arriving for a connection flight at LAX at night during non busy time around 11pm. Refusal to help him find his way through the airport that left him lost and confused to where he missed his flight and had to stay over night. Avoid this airport if possible, if not then keep in mind of the possible hazards here.. this is no joke at all..",ChIJtU-yE9KwwoAR8a2LaVd7qHc
"Gorgeous church situated in the middle of modern skyscrapers.  The external spires and detail is incredible.  Inside, the columns, ceiling, stained glass and more will make your jaw drop to fully see the craftsmanship.  If anywhere near midtown or Times Square, you must visit - if only to appreciate the external beauty.  As of March 2015, much of the inside and outside is covered in scaffolding, but still worth it.",ChIJUW4vEPxYwokRW6o24DU0YIg
very big chruch and located near rockerfeller center. always come to sunday mass. but this church still under renovation for some part of the building. ,ChIJUW4vEPxYwokRW6o24DU0YIg
This is one of the most beautiful things I have seen in my life. We were there on 9/8  and had the tour and it was very informative. If you are in New York this is a MUST SEE. The restoration of the church is nearly complete on the inside and out. This is well worth time to go and it is centrally located to other popular attractions to see also. ,ChIJUW4vEPxYwokRW6o24DU0YIg
"A grand landmark in NYC. Don't miss it if you live here or happen to be a visitor. This majestic church is located on 5th Avenue goes fits in with iit's upscale  surroundings.  The church just went through and extensive renovation. Catholics can attend Holy Mass which is repeated throughout the day, every day. The exterior is a mix of Victorian beauty.  The interior has sculptures with religious figures as well as many beautiful statues. Plenty of room for  those that want to share their prayers,The ceiling stands out with pillars, decorations and religious artifacts.It seems to be  endless with beauty.  Don't forget to stop by. Candles can be lit. See the organ and pope/cardinal chair.",ChIJUW4vEPxYwokRW6o24DU0YIg

Kids bought some of  their favorite characters (toys).  I would like to take this opportunity also to thank V.

"Like other theme parks in the LA area, Universal sells more admission tickets than can be accommodated by the attractions inside.  As a consequence, one is paying for the privilege of spending most of the day standing in line.  Unless of course you spend extra money to be allowed to stand in shorter lines.  The keyword is GOUGE, from parking, to admission, to eating and anything else you need.  I was wondering if they would charge us to exit the park- but maybe I should not suggest that to them. To compound the inadequacy of services offered, they close just when the day is getting best, at 6:00 pm.  I saw one advertisement for Universal saying ""Don't believe what you hear about LA freeways- come on over"" I suggest they take a look at FWY 101 almost any day during the week.

"We enjoy coming to Halloween Horror nights every year and this year was the best by far!! Our family party of 12 paid for general admission fee and we arrived around 5pm to get in the park before it would get really pack. But this year they changed it up and I loved how they had us walk in the park with the whole red wristband thing. We went through the first two mazes The Walking Dead and Insidious within the first hour we arrived. Last year was way too much walking for me so we were so happy you guys brought the trams back to drop us off to Crimson Peak and Alien vs Predator. Great job on all the mazes I felt like I was apart of the movie!!!! The Jabawockeez was a plus to have and the show was great!!!!! Thank you again for the best experience ever and looking forward to what Horror nights will be in the future.

"""art"" my ass. A dirty car engine on the floor. A carpet. Tables wrap in hair. Antique furniture covered in cement. Go for the building not the ""art"". Oh and no photographs of the real art allowed.. Rude  bored staff. What a disappointment. I understand art is subjective but this place seems to make fun of that statement. As in, ""people are so nieve they will believe anything is art if we tell them it is."" It's not.",ChIJmZ5emqJYwokRuDz79o0coAQ
For $25 it's a bit much.  Wanky as hell but the building was beautiful. Most of the galleries are closed.  There was a monet and a few Picasso. Spend more time at the met or MoMA ,ChIJmZ5emqJYwokRuDz79o0coAQ
"Of the many wonderful cultural instructions in the city, the Guggenheim is probably one of my favorite. The architecture is art itself. The people viewing the art is art. The interior never cease to delight me when I go in every time. The art exhibition is always interesting and diverse compared to yet another fashion at the Met or MoMa grand ideas but always seem to fall flat in execution.

They also know how to keep members and member?s viewing time right. The Art After Dark events for members is a social affair that is hip, fun and great way to see the current show away from the mobs of tourists during the day. It actually makes you feel like membership does have its rewards unlike others which just is happy to take our money(MoMa). The event has become popular with a wide age group of professionals so no walkers here(Met) over the years and the bar can become a mad house but we just get our drinks early to skip the mob and then enjoy the art and architecture.
",ChIJmZ5emqJYwokRuDz79o0coAQ
"Absolutely not worth it. Architecture is the main highlight (although you'd seen most of it from the outside). We were not able to count more than 10 ""interesting"" pieces. The permanent collection is not exceptional and the seasonal exhibition (visit on August 4th '15) was not very inspired. Staff mad me think of the prison guards (unfriendly and continuously looking for someone to yell at). Not worth 1h of time and even less 25$.",ChIJmZ5emqJYwokRuDz79o0coAQ
"I have trouble giving this place even just one star. The staff is absolutely horrible. They love to yell and embarrass visitors by yelling at them and scolding them for getting within 3 feet of the art work even though you are nowhere near the line on the floor. One miserable guard on the 3rd floor condescendingly explained to me that I cannot walk behind the artwork... like no shit, sherlock. The one occupancy unisex bathrooms have no working lock so when inside you need to have someone acting as a look-out so no one enters while you're using it. (I assume it was an actual bathroom I used and not an art exhibit) The art is a joke. I hate to criticize art and truly understand art is different for everyone and has a different meaning for everyone but the Guggenheim was reminiscent of a glorified flea market... full of retro junk all melted together. Oh... an orange vacuum cleaner wedged into a purple rock... so amazing. A blanket on the floor... really? This place was a total let-down. I would be embarrassed to work here and even more embarrassed to work as a curator here. The MoMA is so much better. MoMA is actually interesting, fun, inspiring, classy and less ""guards."" Staff at MoMA is wonderful and helpful... Guggenheim should take note. It's not worth 25 dollars. Go to MoMA or the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The only positive of the Guggenheim is the architecture of the building and of the drowning Pinocchio. If I was Pinocchio, I would also rather drown in a shallow pool of water than spend an hour at the Guggenheim. Oh, this is also the first and foremost exhibit upon entering the museum. .. a dead, lifeless, drowning Pinocchio in an actual shallow pool of water... so now you get to explain this to your children... along with every other piece of ""art"" that has a lengthy, pretentious description accompanying each piece to describe the piece to us ordinary folk who will never understand how twisted window blinds on the floor is art.

"The rooms are amazing at this hotel.  The price is pretty expensive but you do get really good service.  If you are going to a convention,  I highly recommend staying here to avoid the massive amounts of traffic.  ",ChIJiwV3rBXEyIARRdN3c345tKE
It you ever upgrade to a room MAKE SURE YOU GET IT IN WRITING!  I was treating friends to a penthouse suite and was quoted one price but imagine my surprise when I got back home and was over charged nearly $100 night more than what I was quoted for the suite.  I haven't stayed at the Venetian in about 4 years but the guest experience and customer service has severely declined.  I gamble at one slot machine for about 45 minutes spending well over $200 and never saw a cocktail waitress.  The better machines are in the old part of Las Vegas on Freemont street as well as friendlier staff.  I think the Venetian is more focused on profits than the guest experience.  Will definitely consider other resorts next time I am in Vegas.,ChIJiwV3rBXEyIARRdN3c345tKE
"The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spacious. However, the place is just too sprawling for my humble taste. Although there were plenty of signs posted throughout the hotel, it was still confusing at times and way too much walking, through crowds of people, to get anywhere. Like any huge business you will run into employees at various jobs who care and try to be helpful and the rest who are there just to collect a paycheck. Overall, I rated it 3 stars because although structurally beautiful, I felt they lost sight along the way that they are in the ""people"" business.",ChIJiwV3rBXEyIARRdN3c345tKE
"Beautiful hotel and rooms but way too big and the service could definitely use improvement. We arrived on a Monday morning, the same time a huge company was arriving for a convention so the place was packed and lines were long everywhere. I was also disappointed that the woman who checked us in never mentioned the $32 a day ""Resort Fee"" which is automatically charged to your bill. I was told later that it was to cover the Internet service (which never worked) and use of the gym (I didn't use) and the coupons for a daily free cup of coffee (which we also didn't use because the coffee shop that honored them was on the opposite side of the hotel from where we were) and there were two other coffee shops right near the elevator. I would've preferred a Keurig in my room. The real highlight was after finally getting into our room, unpacking and beginning to unwind a bit we got a call saying we had to change rooms due to some type of ""maintenance security issue""......they gave us an upgrade to a room with a view but I thought the first room was cleaner and would've preferred to stay where we were instead of repackaged and moving. They didn't even offer us a free dinner or show tickets for the inconvenience.....
I would not stay there again.",ChIJiwV3rBXEyIARRdN3c345tKE
"My wife and I stayed at the Venetian for the second time from October 2 - October 5th. It was AMAZING !

Very disappointing. Every ride had at least a 2 1/2 hour wait. This was the worst park I have ever been to. The staff was rude. My husband got out of line to go to bathroom because we were waiting for almost 2 hours and a staff member told him if he gets out of line again he loses his place.It was suppose to be fright fest but I think I seen maybe 8 people dressed up in costume. I was so disappointed I don't think we will ever go to a six flags again and I don't suggest anyone goes unless you want to waste your money. ,ChIJHcpiHINkwYkRRi8ziGAM1is

Both my friend and I loved it and can't wait to go back. The roller coasters were amazing, I told myself I wouldn't go on Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom but my friend convinced me despite my fear and it was awesome. I love this place. Tip though, not the best for people who don't like thrill/scary rides, and also Green Lantern feels like it's ripping your legs from your body. 5 star would recommend!",ChIJHcpiHINkwYkRRi8ziGAM1is
Very poorly run park.  The rides are great. But very under staffed.  It takes forever to just get in the park alone.  Then once inside the food concessions are so under staffed that food lines are forever.  Not like I remembered it growing up.   ,ChIJHcpiHINkwYkRRi8ziGAM1is
"Went on a Saturday Night.  the bathrooms were beyond gross.  Not one toilet did NOT have piss or feces in it on the seat and floor.  Didn't use it in fear of getting a diease.  Waited over an hour for food at Johnny Rocketts.   Order two pre-cooked, greasy burnt cheese burgers and 2 Chicken fingers for $77.   then waited for one ride for 1 1/2 hours.  After the stress of waiting for food and one ride - I left.   I also wanted to get home before I needed to use the bathroom.  Worst,  dirtiest, over priced place I have ever been.

"We went during Fright Fest because we thought the line would be shorter and the they should've been because there were less people.... However, they decided to only ride one car for each track. It was awful. After about 4 hours in, we broke down and got a fast past. It was an extra 45 dollars per person... Even then, you could only schedule one ride at a time. 

The lockers are abysmal. It is awful that they make you purchase a locker before every ride that expire within two hours (pro tip: you'll be in line longer than that) There was nothing wrong with storing your stuff in the cubbies. You can't even put your water bottle on the other side of the track without having purchased one of their 20 dollar ""sports bottles"" 

Everything was up charged. It is a really expensive day, even when you are doing this on a budget.

Seats range from a park style way up on the lawn, regular stadium like seating to box seats which include picnic tables for an amazing pre-show dinner.

"Drove from OC to see Empire of the Sun, I am sure they were awesome if you were in the closer half of the seating.  But up in the back sections, the sound was AWFUL and you need binoculars to be able to see anything on stage.  I could hear every conversation around me clearly, which shouldn't ever happen at a concert.  Furthermore, the seating is cramped AF.  Waited in line 20 minutes to a get a beer, didn't move a foot, left line to wait for it to die down, returned at 9 and it was closed.  Come to find out you can bring your own alcohol, so our bad for not being prepared.  Oh parking is a nightmare.  We parked down highland in Church lot $25 pricey but it was not stacked, f that. For those of you wondering what ""stacked"" is, it is exactly that, you cannot drive out the lot until everyone else has, you're blocked. 
Really hope to see Empire of the Sun in the future, since this event was so awful we left half way through, not discrediting Empire of the Sun. Waste of time and money unfortunately.  Unless we can afford $150+ seats in the future, I don't think we will ever return to this venue. ",ChIJMwknwRu_woAR_eI2OM9ib2o
"Felt bullied in security. Chose to have the pat down rather than go through the new X-ray machine because there was a sign in front of it that said I had a choice. One woman made two of us stand aside while she called out to no one in particular several times when I asked her to please have someone help us. whilethe other workers stared back blankly. We waited half an hour and kept asking. Meanwhile they let others go through the other machine and we saw people get pat downs. While speaking in their monotone dialogues that they've been handed, security was condescending and clearly had no intention of giving us ""a choice"". As we would miss our plane if we held out for our right any longer we went through the machine reluctantly. They added insult to injury by giving us a pat down as soon as we walked through.

Reception wait times were long. Check in is at 3 and if you wish to get in early, then they charge an additional $10.00, and that if the room is available. The way to avoid that is book normally. And then stand in a separate line to check if the room is ready after housekeeping. If it's done, then you can maybe get in early without the fee.
I've stayed in motels with rooms that offer more, and you don't have to wait for so long at reception desks. At half the price. For a hotel this was unsatisfactory.

"We read reviews and were very confused on what to believe as far as the truth.

Hotel4me. com

We read reviews and were very confused on what to believe as far as the truth. But, one of us wanted to do the rides up on top, so we stayed here because of the cheap price as well as being able to go to the top whenever we wanted for free!

1. We arrived at 12pm and they held our luggage for free so we could go to the Top of the World to eat. It's more of an upscale place, we were very underdressed after traveling half a day to get to Las Vegas. The food was good, but $$$. I wished they would almost allow lunch to be informal with burgers and cheaper food, because the restaurant was empty probably due to the price of he food. As you rotate you have a GREAT view and you can watch the people jump off of the top of the building. It's crazy!

2. Check in was quick because we got there early. Asked for a good view and got the 24th floor right next to the pool! NO UPCHARGE like other hotels in Vegas.

3. The room was great! Clean and well stocked. Everything worked fine, was non smoking, AC worked great.

4. The rides at the top were fairly priced except for the jump was $120, get a coupon from the 50's diner for $20 off. It was a great view watching the sun set at the viewing deck.

5. Lots of places to eat at!

6. Wanted to see the Michael Jackson impersonator show but didn't have time! :(

7. One mile away from the Pawn Stars shop, 3 miles away from Mob Museum, Wedding Chapels, and Freemont Street. WE DID NOT walk anywhere even though it looked safe during the day. WE had a rental car from FOX at $17.00 a day.

8. We will be staying here again!",ChIJ8-0pEYjDyIARB4jQJR4xnxs
"Being a LA Lakers, LA Kings, and LA Sparks fan. Staples Center is really good for sporting events especially when the Chicago Blackhawks, San Jose Sharks, and Anaheim Ducks plays with the Kings the whole Staples Center is on nuts! Then, when the pianist plays ""Let's Go Lakers "" and ""Go Kings Go"" it always give chills. I don't know how though but Staples Center is a great for basketball, hockey, concerts, and WWE events.",ChIJkyrqXbjHwoAR1bJ76zx89B8
"I've been to Staples for Lakers, Clippers, and Sparks games, concerts, and special events. Generally, I think it's pretty good compared to most indoor stadiums. It still looks pretty modern, seats are in pretty decent shape, and the acoustics aren't bad for big concerts (not great, but not terrible).

Outside the stadium, it's cool that there are some statues to take pictures with (Magic Johnson, Chick Hearn) if you're visiting from out of town. They're no Michael Jackson statue like the United Center has in Chicago, but Staples is also buttloads nicer inside, so that feels like a fair trade. 

One of my big complaints with Staples is the 300 level. If you're going to sit on the 300 level at Staples for an event that's televised, you might as well just watch it at home. You're so high up and disconnected from the event that it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense to ""be there to experience it,"" when no one is standing up in the cheap seats. You might as well save your money, have some snacks at home, and watch the game at home.

If it's a concert, I get that there's really no other way to see the person in concert. But I think you'll still be disappointed in the 300 level experience at Staples - it's really, really hard to stay engaged with whatever is happening when you're in the sky.

If you can 100-200 level seats, have a great time at Staples. If you're in the sky, I'd always debate if it's worth it. I've started going to fewer events and making sure that I have better seats to make sure that I get a better experience.",ChIJkyrqXbjHwoAR1bJ76zx89B8
"Staples Center is a chief venue for amusement! I have been here and have seen the Lakers, Kings, Sparks, and a WWE occasion. Each occasion I went to was awesome, and it's a truly fun spot to be. They have a mixture of nourishment choices so it won't be an issue discovering something to eat since they serve more than simply your standard venue sustenance (franks, pizza, and so on). There are likewise numerous alternatives of stopping, obviously the closer you are to the venue the more extravagant it will be.",ChIJkyrqXbjHwoAR1bJ76zx89B8
"Weather you want to see Hockey, Basketball,  a concert, X-games or even a circus act you can always find something fun going on at Staples center. Food and drinks are available inside but most are very high priced. Parking can be expensive but if you look around there are also meter parking as well as some $5 all day parking and don't forget you can also take the metro link train",ChIJkyrqXbjHwoAR1bJ76zx89B8

"This hotel is a classic! Rooms are kept clean and enjoyed the celebrity photos to keep you entertained during the trips on the elevator, which is slow, by the way.  The rooms are small, but it was built back in the day, right? 

Very convenient to everything!  Only half a mile away from food, shopping and entertainment!  

Yes the prices are a bit high, and the parking charges of 40 each day kinda sucks, but if you want that Hollywood experience, you need to stay here at least once.",ChIJazD_QyG_woARwKuHsRqY0nU
"I never take the time to write hotel reviews, but I feel compelled to do so about the Hotel Roosevelt. Even before I arrived, I had to arrange for a delivery to be received on my behalf. I called ahead and spoke to Adam who arranged for my package to be kept safe until my check in 48 hours later. This allowed me to hit the floor running with my jam-packed schedule. 

After what was 24 hours of travel from London, I arrived shattered but I was greeted with a lovely warm welcome. As a solo traveller, I had stayed it the area before but at an Airbnb. I wanted a different experience this trip around so chose the Roosevelt for it's central location. As as non-driver I get around LA on the Metro which is 2 mins away (Hollywood/Highland) and Uber. 

I hung out at the pool in the mornings and the vibe is so chilled, I was always welcomed warmly by Kai who did a great job of making me feel welcome. It's always harder when you are on your own anywhere but every day it was like saying hi to someone who had my back. Ha I rocked up to chill by the pool dressed to the nines in a glittering sari as I waited for my Uber to arrive. Kai and the team were on hand with lovely chit chat to fill the time and help me to blend in (ha ha) 

Sean on concierge was ace when on the first night I lost a filling, he was on hand to help me speak to the front desk team to help me with treatment options. (It worked out great as there's a CVS across the road that is open until 00:00 everyday!

Jeremy on the main entrance was awesome when it came to receiving my Uber's and offered fab advice about places to check out in LA.

I also have to namecheck Sebastian who managed the excellent team. It's a testament to the brilliant team, many of whom I have named. It goes to show how excellent my time was there and the commitment offered by a fabulous team of doers! 

I had my reservations about the Roosevelt, I thought it was going to be old and stuffy. It completely exceeded my expectations as a cool, fun and buzzing place to stay in the heart of Hollywood. It is perfect if you are there on your own like I was or as a group of friends. I wouldn't hesitate to go back or recommend it to my friends. The room was lovely with fab views of the hills and Hollywood Boulevard.
Tip: If you love ping pong, there is a great table hidden away in the gorgeous beer garden.",ChIJazD_QyG_woARwKuHsRqY0nU
"Good but greedy. 

Location and heritage are great.

Just an idea of how greedy these guys are though - water is $10 a litre in room, wifi is $15 a night and parking is $40 a night when the car park directly over the road is half the price.

Pretty good hotel, but their appetite for your cash with these well overpriced extras leaves a bad taste when checking out.",ChIJazD_QyG_woARwKuHsRqY0nU
"We stayed at The Hollywood Roosevelt for my daughters birthday.  They were under construction at the time so we cut our visit short. Explaining my situation to the Front Office Manager, Sabestian Knight he compensated us tremendously. He went out of his way to make sure he could make things right for us.  The staff and security were very nice and helpful.  I would definitely stay there again, but without my kids next time.

"Never again, worst experience ever, Tampa Florida manager Tristan was horrible, I give your customer service a zero.

My wife and I made a reservation 7 months ago and now that we are here for the wedding they have no car for us. We canot do a compact because we are picking up guests. 

Now they say there is an SUV but we can't have it because it is a reservation. But wait we had a reservation. So you show me where the logic is there.

On top of all of this the customer service was horrible. They were rude and unpleasant. The Manager on duty and the desk representative basically wanted us to be impressed that they did there job and rented us a car. There was no compensation for our inconvenience. We missed a family dinner with the bride and groom to be.

We will never rent with them again and I would not recommend there service to anyone. Thanks for the frustration Tampa Florida Dollar Rental. ",ChIJQ0Sek0bCwogRCdUBxgiEW3o
"What airport, actually gets better with age?  This is home base for me so I fly from this airport several times a year and it just keeps getting better.  Most, if not all the terminals have been overhauled and remodeled to look very modern with a traveler centric focus on local restaurants and retail stores.  

Currently they are retro-remodeling the car rental facilities and moving them away from the main terminal area to a more modern (new construction) facility that will be accessed by a 1.5 mile light rail train.  This should really improve the overall experience and make the beloved airport all that better.

Love the terminals here and the set-up of the entire airport is so easy to navigate.  Baggage claim is a cinch to master.  Also arriving and departing flights are a breeze.  This airport is not confusing at all and is really easy to navigate. 

Nice restaurants and shops anchor the main hub complimented by many unique restaurants located in air-side terminals. The main terminal and air-sides have such  a clean and welcoming feel.  This is an airport that you will enjoy flying into.",ChIJQ0Sek0bCwogRCdUBxgiEW3o

Today, it is beautifully restored to its former glory and while it is no longer a movie house or vaudeville it is the permanent home for the Rockets and the 80 year old Christmas Spectacular.... They also give tours so if you're curious about her history, I recommend booking one.

The only thing that bugged me and my husband the most was the harassment about going to see (a show) and people trying to get us to buy into there timeshare. They had offered us 200$ of promotional casino chip to listen to there 1 hour speech that was geared to get us to buy into the resort. We had negotiated for 100$ live chips opposed to the promotional chips. This was the only plus. Other than that the guy was very very extremely rude to us because we did not want to invest. He should have just accepted no for an answer and kept his snobbish remarks.

"One star for the bed.  It was extremely comfortable.  Although, I booked the room three months in advance on the ""concierge"" floor in appearance of receiving a king-size bed.  Unfortunately, this hotel does not have enough King-size bed rooms and we were forced to settle for two full-size beds.
The sink in our room was clogged when we arrived at night.  In the morning, I called to report the clogged sink.  We left and in the afternoon when we returned, the sink was full and apparently overflowed all over the floor.  Someone came to attempt to fix it unsuccessfully.  We had to go down to front desk to ask to change rooms.  Thankfully, we got a new room and moved all of our belongings ourselves.  This ruined our afternoon plans.  The second room was hot and you had to turn the A/C to 65 degrees for it to even feel cool in the room.  
The only manager we ever spoke with was the housekeeping supervisor during the overflow cleaning, who suggested changing rooms.  No other manager ever spoke with us.  Front desk staff did the bare minimum.  Poor customer service, poor facilities, comfortable small bed.  I'm sure other places have just as comfortable sheets and pillows.

"Arrived room wasnt ready for us, so got a free upgrade (concierge level) which is pretty standard for most hotels in this situation.
Which im grateful for, front desk gave us this for the inconvience and gave us benefits for this room (bath robe, slippers, free water bottle). Got to the room no bath robes, noslippers, and water was displayed for purchase for $4. 
All of this was straightened out at the front desk which took more than 30min to get to due to lines, but been given an attitude as if these items were coming out of there pockets....
Next day we read on the official westgate website, concierge level rooms have access to concierge lounge for breakfast. We have been denied this access because we were only given the room not the benefits that come along with the upgrade.
I wouldnt have had any conplaints if i was just given what i paid for, im not disappointed for not getting my free hotel breakfast which its usually not too great but the fact all the employees treat the situation like everything is coming out of there own pockets..and fighting off constant time shares salesman (front desk, random stop attempts from employees) this place is very commision driven so experienced very poor customer service..got very bad attitude when declining time share multiple times.

For exception for Staci who offered to guide us to our room.

"did not like visit to Westgate resort when I booked this hotel  use to be Las Vegas resorts and I like the them but when Westgate took over I knew there would be a problem. I have not had good experiences with Westgate in the past and this was another opportunity for them to mess things up first they charge a $28 resort fee that the old hotel did not charge second they didn't even have continental breakfast how can you charge $28 a day for resort fee and don't have continental breakfast.  rude staff charge too much money for hold on a card I was told the hold was $50 per visit but they charge my card for 450 dollars. in addition they bug the daylights out of me to buy timeshare if I am paying you up front for my room I do not want anyone to bother me about buying a timeshare. this place is a joke same old Westgate never can get things right that's why I never book with Westgate. in addition I called Expedia and filed a complaint because I know that these people will be calling me on my cell phone which I did not give them my number it was given to Expedia but Westgate takes the number anyway and bugs the daylights out of you to buy timeshares.

"Lets start off that I always travel to Vegas for vacation every year. I have never stayed at Luxor Hotel prior to this stay. From the time arriving to the hotel, I have had nothing but problems. From checking into the hotel to getting a room with a A/C that doesn't function properly. Then this story doesn't end here. Its just getting started!  On the 2nd day of our stay we rented a car at Avis which is located downstairs at the main lobby. The person at the front desk told me that they had a Cadillac Escalade when I paid for the amount 300  for 2 days, she then finally tells me that the car is actually unavailable and we got a different car. On top of that the same night my parents extended their stay at Luxor for 1 more night. The person who was handling the paper work FORGOT to put my parents room in correctly so in the middle of the day we got a call telling us to check out of the room or else the luggage's will be thrown out!  I am not kidding you and I barely ever complain but this story only gets worse from here. So my parents arrive at the hotel asking the front desk why the room wasn't booked if the person the day before took all of their information and credit card. Come to find out the card was never charged and the person clearly didn't know how to do his job professionally and the right way. So lets get to the main part of this horrific stay I and my parents had to encounter. Its the last day of our stay . Check out was at 11. My parents checked out of the hotel. There flight wasn't leaving Vegas till 5:45 so they checked in the luggage's to the bell desk man. While sitting in the casino spending last hours at the Luxor there time came to get there luggage's back. Well now come to find out someone ended up walking away with my parents luggage's. Inside was my moms wallet, clothes, shoes, purse and all the identity information. Since my parents are foreign the Hotel managers handled this situation like I am sure they handle all of their situations irresponsibly and unprofessional asking them is they needed something to drink or eat. Are you kidding me ?? of course my parents aren't hungry how could you be when the bell desk man gave away your luggage to some stranger who is nothing but a thief.  When asking to review the camera footage it took them 4 days to review the cameras. I had to fly back into Las Vegas to speak with the general manager who's name is Mark Schonau. After speaking with him on terms of what will happen they told me because the amount was in the thousands of the loss we had to go through rick management. These people who work here have no value in self respect or others let alone know how to handle business and keep it running. Believe me when I say I will take this to every news station possible. If you want to stay at a place who cares nothing about their guests than feel free to stay at Luxor . They are good at doing that !. Have fun and I hope no one EVER gets to experience this type of horrific  stay! I can tell you I will tell everyone NOT to stay at Luxor and to make sure I spread the word.

"I love Luxor. I've stayed in lots of Strip hotels, from Caesars' to Paris to Bellagio to Mirage, but Luxor is always where i gravitate. That it connects to both Mandalay and Excalibur is awesome, the food court is an excellent quick, cheap alternative to spending a load elsewhere and it honestly just looks cool.

More and more people pouring in. Bunch of tvs with animals on them.. Umm I can see the animals at home then? And they no longer have a seahorse exhibit. There is a shark, tuna, otters, jellyfish.  Mediocre aquarium at best. Bunch of tiny exhibits of fishes and random tiny stuff no one cares about to see? Soooo overcrowded I can't stress that enough. for sure not worthy of $40 per person. We will not be returning. And we traveled 4 hours to come here for no reason. ",ChIJ4-RmgarmjYARY5silxlKqLU

It was very crowded on my visit but I still learned a lot and the animals looked to be tranquil and in good health with plenty of room to roam/swim. The exhibits are some of the most elaborate and educational I've ever seen. They took tremendous steps to display the interesting history of the aquarium and I appreciated that a lot.

Also, no mini-bar, microwaves or free wifi. Tried to have my credit card used for incidentals but every time i called room service, I was told I had no credit card on file. This didn't stop the 50 dollar hold per room on my credit card from appearing though. I was told i had to use cash if I wanted room service.

I ate at Sear and the food and service were  both excellent.   Best banana pudding I have ever put in my mouth and I was raised in the South.  The conference food was also excellent. ..sweet potato biscuits were heaven on earth.. I could have eaten a dozen!  Bed was very comfortable.   Room was clean and we'll stocked.   Conference facilities were very nice and enough buffet lines were set up some the 500 guests were quickly served.   Food service gets 5 stars...and my famity owned 6 restaurants so I am a tough critic.  A special shout out to Charles my bellman this morning.   He walked me down to the parking garage and entertained me while I waited.  He asked me about my visit and i explained my only complaint was the odd smell outside my lecture room.  Come to find out it was caused by guests who had set on fire some housekeeping carts and cots.  What is wrong with people??? The remains of this was in the dumpster and was wafting back into the building. Thanks Charles for explaining. 

I was most impressed by the pride he had in his work and the genuine love he has for the Marriott hotel company.

When we arrived we were told parking was full and that it cost 35 dollars per night (exaggerated) we parked next door a public lot (BIG MISTAKE) It was half price but they broke into our truck and stole our ATV. No cameras, No responsibility from the lot. At arrival the line to check in was almost to the door, only 2 reps on a sat night. Waited about 20mins just to check in. The room was ok, the windows were really dirty and apparently our floor was under construction. We were woken up by the sound of drilling and hammering. I was so disappointed I cancelled the 2nd night. At check out the rep was new and didn't know what to do when I asked to keep the rate I was quoted for 1 night. She called her manager for help he treated her like a 5 year old and told her she should do something for us for the inconvenience of the noise. A 50 dollar discount was the best they could do.

I'm in a king-size room and it has only a single chair.  Guess it is a good thing my significant other didn't come with!   We'd have no place to put both of our clothes because we both like to unpack and put things away the minute we get into a hotel room.   And if we wanted to have room service, either he or I would have had to sit on the bed to eat!!!!   The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is the view from the 44th floor is stunning and the concierge lounge is good!",ChIJwxiI1nkE9YgR3dIyOdDBaC8
"Great place. Really quiet at Sunday afternoon. There was a market of artisans. A lot of jewellery but other interesting things like artists. If you try food go to the Mexican, was the best.",ChIJN6W-X_VYwokRTqwcBnTw1Uk
"Absolutely one of top 3 favorite venues in NYC. Very beautiful from the inside. However, the staff who guide you to your seat are jot quite nice. Very harsh sometimes. But I still love this place, and the events that take place in it.",ChIJN6W-X_VYwokRTqwcBnTw1Uk
"Lincoln Center is such a beautiful way to spend an evening!  Take in the symphony, ballet, opera or more.  They even have free events every once in a while - and Sunday meet & greets with the artists.  Look at their website for dates.

Food tip - for a great meal, eat at Bar Boulud across the street (and make sure to avoid Cafe Fiorello).",ChIJN6W-X_VYwokRTqwcBnTw1Uk
"Absolutely breathtaking cultural center that makes me appreciate that NY has more culture than most other parts of the U.S. If you are able to see an opera, ballet or live music performance here, do it. The fountain plaza outside also makes for a romantic stroll. ",ChIJN6W-X_VYwokRTqwcBnTw1Uk
Attended the beautiful March 2nd performance of Don Giovanni. Emma Bell Kate Lindsey and Elza van den Heever gave powerful amazing performances.  Great orchestra. Dmitry Korchak standout as Don Ottavio,ChIJN6W-X_VYwokRTqwcBnTw1Uk
Arrived 1.5 hours early and still barely made the flight. Took over 35 minutes to use the self check kiosk and another 50 minutes in the security line. Recommend arriving 3 hours early for your flight because the airport CLEARLY has never had passengers before. Extra employees stand around playing on their phones rather than helping passengers through the lines quicker.,ChIJucyQYcL95okRZafxtdR6Wyc
"I flew out of Bradley International Airport on August 27, 2015 and it was my very first time taking a commercial flight and I must say it was very easy.  I got through security in less than a few minutes and I was able to go to my gate and await boarding.   Love Bradley International!  ",ChIJucyQYcL95okRZafxtdR6Wyc
Great ppl!!! Not alot of flight options or actuals flights at all.,ChIJucyQYcL95okRZafxtdR6Wyc
We arrived 1.5 hours ahead of our flight and nearly missed the flight.  I have never seen such an unorganized airport.  Check-in was extremely slow and the security line was even slower.  I would highly recommend avoiding flying out of this airport if at all possible.,ChIJucyQYcL95okRZafxtdR6Wyc
"airport is nice and clean but the free wifi is terrible.  If you plan to work in the terminal, as I did, bring a hotspot or some other means to connect, the airport wifi will not satisfy your needs.  If their IT group can fix this the airport would have a five star rating in my opinion.  security was smooth, nice amenities, etc.",ChIJucyQYcL95okRZafxtdR6Wyc

"Loved everything, shops, staff and most of all the view. There was a queue but it moved really quickly. The view is better than Empire State Bldgs so if you are doing both do Empire at night.",ChIJ9U1mz_5YwokRosza1aAk0jM
"I really enjoy my time here. walking around the rockerfeller center, visit the lego store, nintendo store, NBC Store, so crowded here. sometimes you can find a market that sell a lot of stuff here.",ChIJ9U1mz_5YwokRosza1aAk0jM
"One of the must-see attraction in Manhattan. Top of the rock, $32 per person, has the one of the best city view in the world. Gigantic christmas tree and ice skating really shows the spirit of winter. Plan 2-3 hours for Top of the rock and boutiques in busy season. ",ChIJ9U1mz_5YwokRosza1aAk0jM
"A visit to one of the top scrapers is a must if its your first time in manhattan. We chose the Rock because from there you have an excellent view over central park, empire state building, midtown manhattan and much more. A very good start on any vacation.
I give five star because the service was top notch and the views were spectacular. Extra plus for the very friendly guard on the top floor who pointed out the buildings and had some great stories to share.
Thank you very much!",ChIJ9U1mz_5YwokRosza1aAk0jM
"Room was nice. Shower ceiling was falling down and water did not drain in shower for a while.  The hotel has no parking except for an additional 32.00 charge.  They offered to put something in the room for my wife""s birthday which turned out to be milk and cookies. This would have been perfect for a kid, but my wife is much older.  A simple cup cake and a single candle would have been more ideal since you don,t know the age of the person.  Good gesture, but if you really want to do something get more info. Great view from room.",ChIJ86lMh3gE9YgRVGCyTyCJZB0

"We stayed here 10.10.2015 for my daughter's birthday weekend.  After fighting traffic and the confusion to get to the hotel, we were immediately smacked with a mandatory $32 ""valet parking"" expense or it would be $8 an hr heat to park our car where we were staying!Upon checking in, our agent, Connor,  Was very distracted and took little to no time explaining any of the features or protocols of the hotel.The elevators are very confusing, it took us an additional 15 minutes to get to our floor because we kept getting on elevators that didn't access our floor!  Let me add, at this point, that we were traveling with three small girls ages 6,7, and 9!  No one was particularly friendly or helpful. There was an air of snobbiness throughout the entire hotel.To add insult to injury, we were double charged on  both credit cards for the room and the incidentals! Not worth the money or the hassle. Not kid friendly! Won't be staying again. ",ChIJ86lMh3gE9YgRVGCyTyCJZB0
"Parking on site is pricey but the service is top notch. The rooms are being updated, and are kind of on the small side for the regular king size room. The views are great. ",ChIJ86lMh3gE9YgRVGCyTyCJZB0
"There is a 5/Star Security Officer at Westin Peachtree Plaza his name is Mr. Herbert K. This security officer deserve much honor and praise for a ""Honest Job"" well done at this hotel and abroad. It is very rare to find honesty now and days. But this officer is HONEST in all capitol letters and very caring at heart. 
I was told by an elderly lady in Chattanooga, Tn that if you can't trust a person with money: you can't trust them with your life. Well Security Officer Mr. Herbert K. can be trusted with money and you can trust him with your life. 
This security officer believe in returning items to guest that were misplaced or lost along the way. A standing ovation for such honesty. God, bless Mr. Herbert K. Amen",ChIJ86lMh3gE9YgRVGCyTyCJZB0
"What an experience as I am the 352 reviewer of the United Center facility.  Of note is that on the eve of October 27th, President *Barack Obama added a *lightning-spark to the Bulls game as he was back in Chicago on this day.  This remarkable date is annotated as such each year to be of significance to every ball handler upon the court or Tswana coral.  Here mighty Tau ""Lions"" in union with the Taurus Bull manifest a saga join fans from all over the globe.  If your into stars then take note of the eye of the bull, Aldebaran an orange giant star located about 65 light years away in the zodiac constellation of Taurus who also watches the (k)nights action and sportsman like conduct.  I find IT enlightening in these times of media brands that the founding of the NEW matrix is a devilish form of the Protestant movement that formed America... all over again.  So IT's cool that president Obama is a Bulls fan, but what of these haunting mysteries that we hear on the NEWS where apparently a hooded apparition shows up at Atwater and Richard?  Is this some kind of Botswana ball player dribbling in the machine?  And just what is this talk I hear of from the coaches regarding Left, Right, Center as IT relates to Unicode U+ 421?  Another app or apparition face found on not only basketballs but baseballs and other stitched spheres.  I don't know about you but I am going to go to the library and do some research of the various patters of every ball of every sport and do a facial recognition analysis to see what's up.  That being said ""Go Bulls"" and let the readers of this review beware as IF one turns the Bulls logo upside down they will witness the ""Tau Bot"" as such be reading a book upon a table. ?

Best sports arena in the world to me as my all time favorite sports team (Da Bulls) play there.  Had my picture taken next to the 6 NBA Title Trophies which is awesome and ultimate life highlight. I feel at home here.,ChIJT7Wpyj4tDogRRAPwjAbwk5s
"Die hard hawks fan and hockey player and it is truly an awesome place. Plus, the Madhouse Burger is the best: sausage on top of the burger patty! Brilliant idea.

Been to a few Hawks games and the Stanley cup game. Very clean and the staff are nice. Prices for food and drinks are reasonable. They even provide free WiFi which is nice.,ChIJT7Wpyj4tDogRRAPwjAbwk5s
"This stadium has one of the best atmospheres for watching any professional sporting event! Nothing will beat hearing the national anthem before a hawks game for the first time.  Bathrooms are clean, staff is courteous, but beer prices are a little high.",ChIJT7Wpyj4tDogRRAPwjAbwk5s
"This was one of the best, if not THE BEST, scenic sites that I have EVER had the pleasure of viewing.  My sweet husband and I were there for two days, but that was just NOT enough time. I love this beautiful place, and I cannot wait to revisit. I love adventure, so this place is the place for people who enjoy nature. Wyoming and Montana end of it were both amazing. ",ChIJVVVVVVXlUVMRu-GPNDD5qKw
"Absolutely breathtaking. During our trip we saw plenty of bison up close. One even walked right up next to our vehicle. We were also able to see Old Faithful Geyser and plenty of geothermal mud pots and paint pots. I will make it a point to get out here more often. If you happen to visit Wyoming, Idaho, or Montana, make Yellowstone one of your destinations.

The best time of year to visit is just after September. It isn't as crowded and the temperatures are perfect.",ChIJVVVVVVXlUVMRu-GPNDD5qKw
"Such a great experience!  There was a lot of wildlife to see.  Lots of bison, elk and large herd of mountain goats.  There is such beauty there.  The fumeroles were astounding.  Old faithful was unbelievable as were other areas .  Words just cannot explain the beauty!  You have to see it for yourself! I loved seeing the beautiful clear rivers and the fly fishermen. What a great experience!",ChIJVVVVVVXlUVMRu-GPNDD5qKw
"Made a trip out there last week with the family and it was absolutely beautiful!  The park is very well kept, no litter, and plenty of gas, food, and other resource centers scattered throughout!  If you haven't been you should check it out!  If you are coming from the east we stayed in Cody, WY just 45 minutes from the east gate and rooms were very reasonable. ",ChIJVVVVVVXlUVMRu-GPNDD5qKw
"one of the best experiences in my life. everyone at this place is so friendly. the sights are breath taking and unforgettable. I had such an amazing time camping, hiking, and relaxing. From the Geysers to the Canyon/Lower falls to just sitting at the lake, Yellowstone is remarkably beautiful. Yellowstone was hard to leave, specially since I had to come back to city life. I can't wait to go back!!",ChIJVVVVVVXlUVMRu-GPNDD5qKw
"I would like to give zero stars, this has been my worst experience at a hotel. No rooms available when I arrived despite having reservation. Placed in a smoking room that smelled horrible and had cigarette ashes and leaky faucet. I was given explanation of 1st come 1st serve policy- no apology for inconvenience. Then told I would be upgraded to a ""mini suite"" however after 3 trips to reservation I still do not have a room. Terrible customer service, would not stay here again nor    recommend it.

"I come to Vegas 1 to 2x a year on business. Old smoke smelling rooms even if non smoking (I had the best room type before upgrading to a suite. It was roomy but crappy). No amenities (no safe,  no coffemaker,  average fitness,  ok pool,  wifi worked) but have to pay $25 resort fee. Casino is small and basic and boring. Decent service.  Room rates are high compared to value elsewhere on the strip.  I am not sure how they won all these awards they claim. Food was expensive and actually reheated at Beach Cafe with bad service.  Hilton honors let down. ",ChIJx9KzNzPEyIARcKoYGU1i1g8
"This hotel had a very good experience. One of the most friendly places in Las Vegas. Even when they had to give bad news (such as the shopping kiosks being closed), they would provide separate options, and smile.
From the standpoint of only one of 7 billion humans, a smile goes a long way. I didn't meet an employee at this casino or hotel who was not smiling. Would definitely recommend!!!",ChIJx9KzNzPEyIARcKoYGU1i1g8
"I recently stayed at the Tropicana Las Vega from a Thursday to Sunday.   The place was great.   Their hotel, service, and casino was awesome.   Their front desk was very polite, patient, and helpful.  Housekeeping did a great job with the room.  I had called and asked for extra coffee the first night and they brought some up.  However, they remembered and made sure and left extra each day thereafter.  Their Concierge Service was great.  We had a large group, over 25, and needed tickets to the new ride, ?Linq?.  The concierge took great care of me and my group, he called the ?Linq? and got the details that weren?t clear on the brochure, answered all my questions, and also got me a discounted price on each ticket.   The casino was good, the slots were ripe for the taking and I even hit the Progressive jackpot twice during my time there.  They also have a great bar, coffee / food stores, and a convenience store.   I?ll definitely be back to see them again.  ",ChIJx9KzNzPEyIARcKoYGU1i1g8
"Walked in at 8pm. Self-parked our car. Pleasant receptionist gave us an upgrade. We were in the room and settled within 20mins. Beautiful room. Views overlooking the Exculibar, surrounding hotels and the back end of the strip. Layout of the room was lovely, spacious. Clean and tidy. Bed was lovely and soft...so comfy! Linen and blankets were clean. No fridge, microwave or coffee machine tho. Bathroom was clean and spacious. Hardly any noise down this end of the hotel. No cigarette smell. All-in-all a lovely, clean room!! Casino was great, not overly crowded. Brought a few tall drinks ($27each) for the walk down the strip. Loved that they had a Starbucks onsite. Checkout was straightforward...no probs! No surprise extras on the bill. Location was great...it seemed more lively down this end of the strip...lol. Id definitely stay here again!
